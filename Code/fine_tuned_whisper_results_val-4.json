    "but um so building in those things involving parents um i think that's probably why i had become a family therapist um",
    "when i heard that when i was young i interpreted that to mean like oh if i'm not doing it out there then i'm doing it wrong",
    "it's probably hard to miss but i always would have trouble with the old testament names the um hebrew names",
    "uh uh uh uh uh and even slow normal is still noticeably slower than most people's speech rates uh uh uh uh are you talking about therapy in general or or or or or just this particular fluency shaping",
    "and i said the national stuttering association and i said i'm a person who stutters and that for me that's like a very um and just so sometimes so rare",
    "i know that as a child um in school especially in middle and high school i would've volunteered more in class i would've given more presentations but i think that since i had therapy for it in college so when i was in college and graduate school studying speech pathology i felt like i was really able to um be open with people about my stuttering and i don't feel like now it really holds me back anymore except for maybe some very like high pressure situations",
    "oh so when i was little kinda how much earlier had a lot of questions doubts",
    "um so i think that a good friend of mine one time said that you know what's really cool about and it came outta nowhere we weren't even talking about stuttering per se we were just talking about like we hadn't seen each other in a long time this was a friend from high school and he kinda said he goes you know it seems like you having to deal with this and he said this he didn't say stuttering but he said you having to deal with this really gave you a purpose that a lot of other people don't get and i guess i'd thought about it that way but you don't always you know your acquaintances and your friends you don't really always say those kinds of things to each other i think especially perhaps men",
    "not at you yeah ooh what causes stuttering",
    "like i would intentionally tell the teacher and luckily they're they don't force me until i was about in high school they respect that",
    "okay so currently um i am about to transition into um year so i'm in the midst of job hunting and um and so i'm busy with that so um and finishing up the last bit of school",
    "hmm uh i assume it's genetic uh it's probably a physiological uh thing both mind and body uh uh i've heard some um uh uh maybe uh your transmitters aren't from your brain aren't sending the right messages to your muscles",
    "like a speech impediment with like language and then i guess i was a late talker too and then everything just builds up and then i put in like fillers too as you can hear",
    "um so i did therapy i did not appreciate it really much what has helped me is to meet other people who is who stutter",
    "uh but my brother i think had practiced a lot of that and it's just now he's learned to word swap i think that's his biggest tool is just changing out those words that he knows he's gonna have a block on for a young stutterer the message that i would give them is something that i wish i had done as a teenager",
    "and i just stayed on the phone and kept saying you will refund this money now or else you're going to have to be dealing with the federal government like agency i'm blanking on the name right now that will oh uh the fcc will be dealing with this and you will have to deal with my bank and you will have to deal with my credit card company and they kept trying to put me off like make better offers and i really thought that was great",
    "and just any um like support group that empowers like kids and teens and adults who stutter and just make sure that people know that like stuttering doesn't have to hold them back and like it's okay to stutter",
    "and uh biofeedback was just starting to come out so worked on biofeedback relaxation skills",
    "i think it's definitely um i mean i'm like i don't work in the field and i guess i'm pretty conscious about like the terminology i use but just kind of like it is uh from what i can assess of it it is a disorder that the brain has and that impacts everything else and so um and during my lived experience i think of just uh waking up one day and having stuttering be there uh waking up one day and having stuttering be gone",
    "and i commend you for having the compassion to be able to help people because you the impact that a speech language pathologist can make on a stutterer is huge but also on the parents of a stutterer and i think that's something else to where uh the parents need to also have some people to talk to",
    "well let me see if it was i know i've stuttering for as long as i can remember when i was in grade school i we were they put us they put me in a speech class",
    "so everything i've read and i've think i've probably read as much as any person who just stutters and so i'm i believe the that it's a physiological cause",
    "or i guess not everyone probably a natural distribution of people if you hate it like it probably be in the middle somewhere",
    "which is only the third one in the entire world and it was formed for the purpose of those who stutter i'm going to cut this off",
    "oh um i wanna say everything but i feel like it would be everything in terms of actual things i feel like be everything in terms of intensity i would just be able to express myself more i'd probably be able to enjoy life more have a much stronger zest for it um",
    "cause when i talk to people i know well i stutter less oh and with strangers i stutter more uh also i don't stutter when i whisper or sing or when i'm uh uh uh like angry i don't  yeah so",
    "well i think it's definitely genetic because my dad has a stutter um i confirmed that with him i wanna say maybe a year ago and so his um speech pattern is like mine",
    "and friends but not about my stuttering uh uh it's always been a taboo like topic um but um recently uh i've been a part of the nsa",
    "like if the world was like the nsa i think stuttering would sound and look different um i don't think the way we speak is directly written in our genes or in our brains i think it always interacts with where we're living i had speech therapy when i was really young",
    "or gone to a speech therapy and it was um i thought it was very ineffective you know the time i didn't know what to expect",
    "something in and uh he was able to prove when we stuttered a spoke into delayed auditory feedback machine we spoke with fluency",
    "well i have already achieved a lot of success but it was a struggle at each way and there were some things i didn't do because of my stuttering",
    "um just in general i guess when i feel that the person i'm speaking with that we're understanding each other we're on the same wavelength and uh there isn't that sort of confusion where we're not quite sure what the other person is saying and even with a stutter that's possible but it can be obviously more challenging",
    "and um i think that we both need to give ourselves a break uh because i think that people who stutter are probably harder on themselves than you know some other folks who are you know probably dealing with things that are uh very similar but not as clearly obvious to the outside world um and i think that the world uh uh would do better to learn more about us",
    "for it started for my articulation uh i think i had a lot of speech sound errors and i remember while i was in therapy for articulation i developed my stuttering and i don't remember much speech therapy targeting my stuttering i remember mostly about articulation like practicing saying certain sounds and you know working up to saying them in sentences and things",
    "with a speech pathologist who specialized in stuttering and i saw her for about a year and a half and that was a good experience we i would say half the therapy was fluency type stuff and half of it was attitudinal and sort of changing my perceptions of stuttering and facing my fears",
    "we moved from this the urban part of where i lived to the more suburban part of where i live from the city of poughkeepsie to the town of poughkeepsie when i was in middle school in sixth grade and i told my parents i was tired of the speech therapy i didn't wanna do it anymore and then didn't receive therapy again until high school",
    "but when she was talking about this in the group um i said i'm glad you stayed because you didn't let her win if i didn't stutter i don't think anything would be different um because i have my own problems that i've dealt with personal problems uh with talking to people",
    "um so yeah so okay i think that's it for question two um question three",
    "you know uh uh to uh become an uh emt you know um um um the instructors um they said that my speech could have been a you know you know problem um in hindsight it might have been a problem or not",
    "a lot of people i had contacted worked with like preschoolers which didn't help me but i was very fortunate that i found a great slp she did a combination of like a lot of counseling acceptance like desensitization work with some i would say fluency sheet being a stuttering modification like throwing a big emphasis on it like being okay to stutter and stuttering openly as well",
    "but that was the only feedback that i got from her um and so i think that like while it wasn't directed towards my stuttering per se i feel like it did help me read more effectively like out loud",
    "it's not weighing me down it's on my hip it's on my side",
    "tell people that you stutter and meet other people who stutter i think that's the most important thing so you don't feel alone um they should just accept it they should not finish uh what i'm about to say they should um just behave like it's a normal thing um",
    "and tell for example uh tell your teacher and your colleagues and your uh uh the people around you that you stutter so they know what it is and that they don't think that you're weird or anything um i'm not sure i answered the question but uh um",
    "um um well i'm about to say you know here at this meeting but that's a bit it's not really a good answer um but i think that's the best answer i can give um yeah but i don't know",
    "you know and outside of college i really haven't had speech therapy because it costs a lot of money successful communication is when you can get your message across to the person that you are speaking to",
    "and uh that was pretty annoying because uh they had me reading to parent volunteers the whole wizard of oz books",
    "primarily my mother this is kind of where what i try and say and what she hears are two different things um can i give a positive example of a communication can you give an example of a positive so um can you give an example of a positive communicative experience um i think my going through my mba program and just kind of having a presentation for every class and like where you have to get into suits and just do that and that was kind of fun it was if anything that program gave me more confidence that i could stuff sure i'll",
    "sometimes i wonder if this is actually something that occurred because of the stuttering or is it because i held myself back my answer now is that it's because i held myself back i don't think this had to happen",
    "and i personally don't think that's ever going to happen you know in the like like like physical i'm going to take a pill",
    "and you know it's still here so i mean yeah i think just conveying your point in a competent way",
    "um went through it in a very organic way because i kinda forgot that i was seeing a speech therapist which was good um but again she had she did not detect anything um in any activity although the only thing that she said was when i was reading she told me that at times i was reading too fast",
    "i just won six hundred million dollars can't you tell how happy i am no",
    "but my friends are pretty good cool with that so they let me talk too so",
    "um you know uh that i could choose from uh to address uh stuttering in the way that i see um best",
    "it not a lot of change uh successful communication means um that uh developed an understanding uh with my audience or person",
    "i'm not put off by it but then there's stuttering and there's stuttering and there's stuttering and then there's the speech impairment uh successful communication means essentially to me",
    "is stepping outside of our comfort zone joining clubs joining activities that forced me to speak so i did a lot of that when i was at howard",
    "it's an educational process about stuttering what do i think causes stuttering well i know a little bit more than just the average person that",
    "but um it's just normal speech right so uh and i'm not sure if i do it well anymore or not because it was in two thousand and three and um i haven't had any uh therapy since then",
    "'cause i don't stutter that badly but um i think don't finish the word for the person um that's kind of i guess rude",
    "once i got acclimated to my new environment that did not happen um so my first years of college",
    "or stop before i finish what i wanna say that is a good conversation i did think uh if my job will be there like same job",
    "and uh that's my perception i try not to go there as often as i did when i was young it did cause me an issue in college",
    "so kind of i was always speaking with a known group so that was that seemed to help reduce some anxiety the audience was the hard part of the",
    "and that uh uh and the new therapy styles uh uh uh style uh uh uh uh seem to be a different paradigm uh in that the goal is not making you fluent the goal is making you an easier stutterer",
    "um so talking about it with family just didn't really happen with a couple of my close friends i could um with my family when i would tell them i was coming to these conferences i just said i was coming to get credits for my certification",
    "um uh i imagine i would it's altered everything so uh whether it's good or bad i'm thankful now i look back and i wasn't in able to get into the military 'cause that was the height of the iraq war i may have been killed in iraq if i got in",
    "like i wouldn't know what a non stuttering me would even do or you know you know be um might i have a different job possibly",
    "and uh around that time i began to spend more and more time just me and i got to a point where like therapy hadn't worked you know and i was kind of over it",
    "which is a very different mindset uh uh uh uh and what uh they seem to focus on uh uh uh uh although uh uh all i know is from just talking to people",
    "and um i recently retired for about a year and a half ago and i still obviously still stutter",
    "i absolutely believe based on my experience uh there's still a great many more things that are available for us today but i believe the key is acceptance acceptance of yourself and how you project to others",
    "okay um my stuttering i i've stuttered since i as long as i can remember sixty two years old",
    "if you are able to stutter without it anticipating the stutter and then reacting to the stutter and then thinking about the stutter afterwards there's like three moments where you can where the stutter can be disruptive but i think that stutter can happen without anticipation without reaction and without uh rumination um and so it's i think the stutter can be left alone and you can concentrate on those other things",
    "with my work situation uh i've got uh bunch of friends both from where i currently live and from all of the places that i've previously lived",
    "um related to stuttering um plus i knew i wanted to go to college but i was really anxious about job interviews and didn't know career i wanted to pursue and i felt like stuttering was really holding me back so i decided on my own to um seek out a speech therapist and it was surprisingly difficult to find a speech therapist who works with teenagers who stutter",
    "so um something different in my life i don't think that much",
    "but um in when i'm in school like it's fine because i mean everyone should understand right i'm also like the uh i'm also the cochapter leader of the san jose uh national stuttering association support group so um yeah i'm definitely more open there",
    "with desensitization and um just changing you know again my relationship with stuttering learning um you know all the tools",
    "and it's a part of some of the things we're hearing today with acceptance instead of trying to fight it once you've accepted it in my perception you begin to speak with more confidence it's easier and i tend to speak more fluently",
    "and it has motivated me to continue pursuing public speaking and to not shy away from that because it is important to be able to do that once i become a physical therapist probably wouldn't have the great friends that i do now uh i think that it has helped me to meet a lot of people i wouldn't have ordinarily met and i think i would have really followed a different path in my life because where i grew up i was around a lot of uneducated individuals low socioeconomic status and i think it actually helped me in the long run",
    "you need both people to listen and listen to what people are saying not what they're thinking they're saying",
    "she wasn't a specialist uh there in stuttering even though she really cared and i think that she did a lot of kind of um um her own research to try to like figure it out so i you know like i felt like i was in like a really safe place with her um and you know there were times where we would be within the sessions and you know things would start to uh to sound more fluent but you know it never uh was a cure all",
    "but anyhow this therapist she took her extra time to learn about stuttering um and she tried her hardest to uh help and get feedback from me um and then high school therapist she was kind of had the same attitude",
    "'cause i don't know where i would be i don't know who i would be as a person if i did not stutter",
    "uh no one knows the exact cause of you know you know you know stuttering um there seems to be a strong genetic link to stuttering um i have two boys",
    "pardon oh um oh um my spouse is also here you'll hear um i tried at one point",
    "and then they gradually speed you up to one second a syllable half a second a syllable and then something called slow normal",
    "so it was just kind of like it's I'm just there to be a little bit icing on the um wedding cake for the for metaphor so yeah so i think that's a positive",
    "um well uh i went to school for anthropology and i've also done music",
    "you know it's really interesting sometimes i feel like i stutter more uh with my family um and sometimes with my friends as well particularly friends that i haven't seen for a while but that i you know have a very close relationship with it's like i always feel like i'm kind of like uh reintroducing uh my stuttering to them even though it's clear that uh they've always known me as",
    "then i can so um put your money where your mouth is um believe in us",
    "and um i think i get most of my techniques from what they've taught me at hollins which is a stretch syllable and easy onsets and um i think i use those uh not like unknowingly and um i'm now looking at other uh programs",
    "and i guess just not feeling any guilt at the end of it so by that what i mean is you know not having well i guess like guilt isn't the word",
    "um because there really isn't anything in those courses that necessarily says that my voice has to be fluent and so every time i would give those um i would both have excellent feedback",
    "uh my stutter uh does not impact my daily life uh uh uh life all that much right now uh uh uh in that i'm uh uh i'm uh uh very happy",
    "but um uh i've always loved sequencing so that kinda thing comes to mind",
    "um and then uh since at the time my stuttering originated uh with reading and so and then it obviously uh showed when i would speak to people too so uh but it was i couldn't tell if i was mild or i just was able to do things to kinda hide it",
    "uh prospects um stuttering doesn't define me as a person like i don't i try not to let it",
    "so question five if you didn't stutter what might be different in your life um i guess i might have been more confidence in different things in my life uh",
    "uh it was hard for me to detect because he also didn't grow up in the us he grew up in the philippines so english is a second language",
    "and since then i've been trying to be more opened with my stuttering talking about it for the first and sometimes i'm good at it sometimes the covert um tricks of the trade kick in",
    "um and are much more open to what i have to say it also is an amazing thing in court because judges zero in on exactly when they see what i'm saying and often has actually made uh my comments towards my clients hold more ground which is really fun",
    "everyone is capable of anything that they can think of right i mean you just you need a plan and then action so i mean uh yeah that's it i'd say",
    "but there was the adrenaline rush and so it was kind of that was kind of fun to do where it was like you do it and you feel great you're um i had an um let's say hour",
    "seemingly unrelated to stuttering whether it's uh depression or psychological issues or other issues uh fears and other emotional things and so i feel that often my stuttering acts as like a way of connecting with people more and in that way um i do think about when i'm speaking trying to stutter as openly as possible",
    "it's helped me feel like more authentic i guess successful communication to me means just saying whatever i wanna say um for most of my life i would just not say anything",
    "and she taught me these techniques you know like um easy onset and prolongations and stuff but i don't really use it much but i feel like i do have a slower rate of speech",
    "and it was that pivotal moment that has carried me through my life and my career i said i if i can do this the thing i dreaded the most",
    "so i think um so sometimes it's okay to go off script you know and let them like get whatever they have to get off their chest",
    "but therapy can be done on your own even outside of the therapy room um you know community is a big part of it um and i think that even extends out to everyone else",
    "in the communication even though they the or the or in the discussion even though they clearly didn't wanna be having it and i thought that was really positive and at that point it didn't really matter that i stuttered or not 'cause i was um again saying what i wanted to say communicating it in the way i wanted to say it",
    "um maybe i wouldn't be um you know like a good uh uh as good of a listener that i feel that i am today so like some small like changes like that i think would be different",
    "um who passed away when i was two so can't confirm it but she says he did and also apparently his father did so my great grandfather so and that's just on my mom's side of the family and one of my cousins on my dad's side has a son who stutters who's a teenager so um i feel like there's definitely a strong genetic component",
    "went to stores and had me really go through that fear hierarchy of difficult speaking situations and i think that the desensitization piece plus me feeling like i could really trust her she was actually the first one who ever told me that it was okay to stutter and that i think was like the biggest thing 'cause my whole life i thought it wasn't okay just because it was something not everyone does",
    "so um but it's just kind of never getting the support from my parents and confidence to do things where i could potentially make an ass of myself not realize if i did make an ass of myself i would be protected from any um bullies or anything like that",
    "um so it's not something that i hide and it's not something that i try to hide but i guess i always do wish that i could be uh more fluent uh uh than what i am um my interactions with family and friends",
    "for an in service day and i think the most positive was within a minute of my the beginning of my presentation i right away said i am a person or i'm sorry i'm a covert person who stutters and i said it out loud to twenty five colleagues in the workshop",
    "and that was a long time ago and back then they thought i had a learning disability rather than stuttering i was it was my turn to read in the circle",
    "i was closer to my mother and i have two siblings a brother and a sister and i don't think i'm close to them at all uh school and again it uh completely affected me um the courses i took were courses i wouldn't have to speak in",
    "um and then i think from there there's a huge impact related to learning and to um just like living as a person who stutters that tends to lead to the condition getting potentially worsened but certainly more complex and that's how i think people begin to learn ways to actually make their stuttering more difficult strangely enough as they're trying to help themselves",
    "um at the nsa conference last week um there were guys in the military who stuttered uh they said that i probably just had a bad doctor that i the doctor was probably having a bad day that day and just didn't wanna i don't know or maybe he was just a jerk so uh yeah so um yeah it's",
    "that's kind of a tough question because every stutterer is different and they react to specific questions differently and i've been a part of the interview project with the dallas chapter now for a few years where i have future slps talk to me um or interview me and it's always the same ten questions and you can give them advice at the end",
    "for that to really sort of sink in um um yeah so that's a that's the reader's digest version of it but i could talk on that for two hours and a half",
    "but it provides me with so much entertainment and so many interesting things that i think i would i don't think i would be nearly as happy i don't think i would be nearly as fulfilled i don't think i would be as culturally confident",
    "or probably a mutation or a series of mutations somewhere down the line okay",
    "but help them with their goals and whatever that may be um don't force your agenda on them",
    "i didn't know why they didn't say i stuttered it was just a speech class",
    "so that gave me some confidence but i gave the speech to i guess several hundred people but at the end of the speech and until this day i look back at it",
    "i mean nobody has ever told me what i can and can't say and nobody ever will prevent me from saying what i want my impression is that stuttering has always been genetic i have not done any genealogy research",
    "to gain my like confidence back so yeah i would say would just be that if two people can understand each other that is the main point",
    "the great majority of people will not be able to uh uh uh uh so that's the single biggest uh uh uh as to criticism that i have because it just does not transfer to the outside world",
    "he said i had some he like a he said i had a thick tongue and a thick frenulum and he wanted me to practice some quacky technique i didn't buy into that",
    "do not interrupt them uh uh uh uh uh uh do not talk over them uh uh do not fill in their words",
    "what if i stutter what if this and what if that um nowadays not so much",
    "so i became an engineer but i uh to get back to it i do i believe i could have been more successful had i had support earlier and there were more effective speech therapies then quite possible",
    "so i can't wait to see like really what causes that so yeah uh i would say",
    "i went to the covert workshop as a speech pathologist i never knew what i was doing had a name so i went and i heard all the stories",
    "the fluency stuff um i don't think it did much i don't remember many ever being able to use any of it in real life or it really changing anything but the attitudinal stuff really pushed me to start seeing my life as a stutterer instead of really seeing it as only being able to be lived unless i if i was fluent",
    "i graduated in like like film and tv and like um some editing work and then just i wasn't really happy",
    "um historically my stuttering has uh prevented me or held me back in um school activities uh public activities um i've always been pretty open with my family",
    "so if i get if i try to get over ninety percent on everything else but this one thing maybe it won't be so bad but then um but then that also maybe without stuttering it would've also changed the pressure that um was put on uh by both myself and my parents because then they're like hey why are you lacking in this",
    "um and it you know and yeah i think with my success in you know uh professionally and socially i think i'd probably much easier time than i do now but it's not to um say that everything would be perfect if i didn't stutter and you know there'll still be challenges and things like that and um but um um and i guess also too uh mean i one thing i've been that helps me to think about positive experiences um that i had that i wouldn't have had if i didn't stutter",
    "i still use to this day and then i think i had one other short term therapy after about two years after out of of college um",
    "so i mean it could be genetics yeah i don't think there's an exact cause so if i've ever had therapy is that the question",
    "uh i am doing a master in biology so of course i looked it up uh so i know it's like gene",
    "um i will say that it has impacted my life um i when i was like younger in school i will hate to do like the oral presentation",
    "i don't know um i actually was at the mall last week surveying people",
    "like that's how i am if you don't like it well go to hell i don't care",
    "um i guess what i do know is what didn't happen and this is more of me going back to the uh question two",
    "just because i've been doing it so long um one quick example when i was waiting for my airplane on um wednesday i i started talking with this couple and they we uh talked about where we were going",
    "that was wonderful yeah um just being able to say what you wanna say regardless if you stutter or not",
    "you know i think uh you really realize that you don't take speech for granted so you know you realize the value of being able to express yourself and you can um uh you know and i think you when you try to say things that have more meaning instead of just rambling",
    "know um i personally i have had a lot of emotional problems and concepts that existed for a long time because i didn't really have speech therapy you know so just please keep in mind that you have to treat the speech problems that the person has",
    "wasn't about uh using techniques which i did learn and relearn but more about accepting the fact that i stutter",
    "i hated being there for it i did the therapy i did all the exercises the night before and she kind of knew it and i really hated how i sounded and then in high school i wanted do something different and i wanted to change myself",
    "but stuttering sort of breaks up all those patterns and forces people to really uh communicate with each other outside of those routines and i think that makes communication more successful 'cause it's not bound by heuristics um a recent communicative exchange that was successful was",
    "so um yes i did when i was younger",
    "um in my daily life it doesn't have an impact on me um because i don't allow it to have an impact on me um uh i think it's worse in my job uh where i talk to customers um and they don't know that i stutter and i have to be you know very professional",
    "the graduate school i went to purdue offered therapy for free to its students and i went there and that was actually a good experience uh the first guy i saw was probably good but i didn't think i was ready for it",
    "okay i'm gonna end it here and start a different file for each of the six questions what do you think causes stuttering i've always assumed there was a genetic component to it",
    "um it just happens to take us a bit longer to talk um yeah",
    "you know know the terminology um know what people struggle with um three like never forget that yes like there are people who stutter but they're more than just their stutter too",
    "the stuttering will lessen on its that's something i've learned myself i didn't learn that until i was really really when i reached middle years",
    "and why how of does that work uh i know that we do not all of them yet",
    "so i've had tremendous outcomes through avoidance reduction therapy sure so successful communication to me means that other people understand you and you're able to convey your messages in a way that's enjoyable for both parties",
    "i mean for me i don't really have to speculate because for you know the first eighteen years of my life i didn't stutter and um uh and since i know it i just compare myself uh to the way i was then and the way i was now and you know i was so much more confident and i had a lot more of a social life then and uh you know kind especially when i got to college and started stuttering i mean i lost a lot of that and so it's now it's kind of a matter of trying to get that all back"
  ],
  "hypotheses": [
    "but um so building in those things involving parents um i think that's partly why i had become a therapist um",
    "when i heard that when i was young i interpreted that to me and like oh if i'm not doing it out there then i'm doing it wrong",
    "it's probably a hard mess but it i always would have trouble with the old testament names the um fever names",
    "uh uh uh uh and even slow normal is still noticeably slower than most people's speech rates uh uh uh uh are you uh uh uh you talking about therapy in general or uh uh uh uh that's not how you define someone",
    "and i said the national stuttering association and i said i'm a person who stutters and that for me that's like a very um and just sometimes rare",
    "i know that as a child um in school especially in middle and high school i would have volunteered more in class i would have given more presentations but i think that since it had therapy for in college so when i was in college and graduate school studying speech pathology i felt like i was really able to um be open with people about my stuttering and i don't feel like now it really holds me back anymore accept for me some moment but it doesn't affect me as much i guess",
    "oh so when i was little i kind of had my charlie i had a lot of questions about",
    "um so i think that a good friend of mine one time said that you know what's really cool about and it came out of nowhere we weren't even talking about stuttering per se we were just talking about like we hadn't seen each other in a long time this was a friend from high school and he kinda said he goes you know it seems like you having to deal with us and he said the same thing stuttering but he said you having to deal with us really gave you a purpose that a lot of other people don't get and i guess i thought about it that way but you don't always uh stutter and i think that the best way to learn about stuttering is to talk to a person who",
    "right yeah what causes stuttering",
    "like i have actually something to secure and likely there they didn't watch me so that was quite nice um respect that",
    "okay so currently um i am about to transition into um uh a career so i'm in the midst of a job thing um and so i'm being held back by my stutter",
    "hmm uh i assumed it's genetic uh it's probably a physiological uh thing could both mind and body uh i've heard something um uh uh maybe uh your transmitters aren't okay with that well from a brain on it kinda kick out of stuttering",
    "like a speech impediment with like language and then i guess i was a late talker too and then everything just spelled up and then i put in like fillers too as you could hear",
    "um so i did therapy i did not appreciate it really much what has helped me is to meet other people who stutter",
    "uh but my brother i think had practiced a lot of that and it's just now he's learned to workshop and i think that's his biggest tool it's just changing out those words that he knows he's gonna have a block on for a youngster the message that i would give them is something that i wish i had done as a teenager",
    "and i just stayed on the phone and kept saying you will refund this money now or else you're going to have to be dealing with the federal government like agency i'm blanking on the name right now that will oh the fcc will be dealing with us and you will have to deal with my bank and you will have to deal with my credit card company and they kept trying to put me off put me off like make better offers make better offers and i really thought that was great",
    "and just any um like support group that empowers like kids and teens and uh adults who stutter and just make sure that people know that like stuttering doesn't have to hold the back and like it's okay to stutter",
    "and uh by a feedback was just starting to come out so worked on by a feedback relaxation skills",
    "i think it's definitely um i mean i'm like i don't work in the field and i guess i'm pretty conscious about like the terminology but just kind of like it is uh from what i think it's exacerbated is it is a disorder that the brain has and that impacts everything else and so um and through my elliptic experience i think i'm just uh waking up one day and having stuttering be there uh waking up one day and having stuttering be gone",
    "and i can mend you for having the compassion to be able to help people because you the impact that a speech therapist can make on the stutterer is huge but also on the parents of a stutterer and i think that's something else where uh the parents need to also have some people to talk to",
    "well let's see the four is uh i know i'm a stutterer for as long as i can remember when i was in grade school i we put a stutterer in a speech class",
    "so everything i've read and i think i've probably read as much as in the uh person i just stutters and so i'm believe that it's a physiological cause",
    "i guess not everyone probably a i uh national just to speech people if you like it probably in the middle somewhere",
    "which is only the third one in the entire world and it was formed for the purpose of those who stutter and it cut this off",
    "uh um i wanna say everything but i don't feel like he would be everything in terms of actual things i feel like he would be everything in terms of intense i would just be able to express myself more i probably be able to enjoy life more have i much stronger zest for it uh",
    "'cause when i talk to people i know well i stutter less oh and with strangers i stutter more and so i don't stutter when i whisper or so and i also don't have a really specific because i think i've had a bunch of successful uh experiences",
    "well i think it's definitely genetic because my dad has a stutter um i confirmed that with him on a say maybe a year ago and so his um speech pattern is like mine",
    "and friends but not about my stuttering it's always been a taboo like topic um but um recently uh i've been a part of the nsa",
    "like if the world was like the nsa i think stuttering would sound and look different um i don't think the way we speak is directly written in our genes or in our brains i think it always impacts me i had speech therapy when i was really um",
    "going to speech therapy and it was um i thought it was very effective the time i didn't know what to expect",
    "it's something and uh he was able to prove when we stutter and spoke into a delayed auditory feedback machine we spoke with fluency",
    "well i've already achieved a lot of success but it was a struggle at each way and it was some things i didn't do because of my stuttering",
    "um just in general i guess one i feel that the person i'm speaking with that we're understanding each other and we're on the same wavelength and uh there isn't that sort of confidation we're not quite sure what the other person is saying and even with the stutter that's possible but it can be obviously more challenging",
    "and um i think that we both need to give ourselves a break uh because i think that people who stutter are probably harder on themselves than you know some other folks who are you know probably dealing with things that are not very similar but not as clearly obvious to the outside world um and i think that the world would do better to the outside world uh",
    "for it started for minor articulation i uh i think i had a lot of speech centers and i remember while i was in therapy for articulation i developed my stuttering and i don't remember much speech therapy targeting my stuttering i remember mostly about articulation like practicing saying certain sounds and you know working up the synapses and things",
    "with a speech pathologist who specialized in stuttering and i saw her for about a year and a half and that was a good experience we i would say half the therapy was fluency type stuff and half of it was atatoutable and sort of changing my perception of stuttering and phishing my fears",
    "we moved from this the urban part of our life to the more suburb of our life from the city of the kids to the town of the kidsy when i was in middle school in sixth grade and i told my parents i was tired of speech therapy i didn't want to do it anymore and then didn't receive therapy again until high school",
    "but when she was talking about this in the group um i said i'm glad you stayed because you didn't let her win if i didn't stutter i don't think anything would be different um because i have my own problems that i've dealt with personal friends who stutter um and i make them feel welcome and i try to make them feel welcome",
    "um so yeah so okay i think i saw some question two um question three",
    "to become an eon um um and tio um tio um the instructors um the supervisors um the supervisors uh who aren't worried about my stuttering",
    "a lot of people like contact and work with like preschoolers which in hand with but i was very fortunate that i found a great slp she did a combination of like a lot of counseling acceptance like desensitization work with um i would say like fluency shaping and stuttering modification like stuttering but like a big emphasis on it like being okay to stutter and stuttering openly as well",
    "but that was the only feedback that i got from her um and so i think that like while it wasn't directed towards my stuttering per se i feel like it did help me read more effectively like out loud",
    "it's not reading me down it's on my side",
    "to people that just stutter and meet other people who stutter i think that's the most important thing so you don't feel alone um they should just accept that they should not finish what i'm about to say at the um just behave like it's a normal thing um",
    "and until fxx until your teacher your colleagues and uh the people uh around you that you stutter so they know what it is and they don't think that we have heard anything um i'm not sure i answer the question but uh",
    "um um well i'm about to say you know he at this meeting but that's a bit smugly like your answer um i think that's the best answer i can give you but i don't know um i don't have a really specific because i think i've had a bunch of successful um experiences",
    "you know and outside of college i really haven't had speech therapy because it costs a lot of money successful communication is when you can get your message across to the person that you are speaking to",
    "and uh that was pretty annoying because uh they had me reading to parents volunteers the whole wizard of us books",
    "publicly my mother's just kind of where what i try and say and what she hears are two different things um can i give a positive example of a community case or can i give an example of a positive um um uh um a work visit so um can you give an example of a positive communicative experience um gonna think about it going through my nba program and just getting my words out that doesn't give um to be in the moment or uh connect with other person or just enjoy the interaction",
    "sometimes i wonder if this is actually something that occurs because stuttering is because i help myself back my answer now is that it's because i help myself back i don't think this had to happen",
    "and i partially don't think that's ever gonna happen you know in the like physical i'm going to take a pill",
    "and you know it's still here so i'm in the uh i think just conveying your point in a competent way",
    "um went through it in a very organic way because i kind of forgot that i was seeing the speech therapist which was good um but again she did not detect anything um in any activity although the only thing that she said was when i was reading she told me that at times i was reading too fast",
    "i just won six hundred million dollars can't you tell how happy i am no",
    "but my friends are pretty good cool with that so they let me talk to so",
    "um you know uh that i could choose from uh to address uh stuttering and the way that i see uh the best",
    "it's not a lot of change uh successful communication means um that i've developed an understanding uh with my audience or person",
    "i'm not put off by it but then they're stuttering and they're stuttering and then there's a speech impact and uh successful communication is essentially found to me",
    "is a step in our side of our comfort zone joining clubs joining activities that forced me to speak so i did a lot of that while i was at how it",
    "it's an educational process about stuttering what do i think causes stuttering well i know a little more than this average person that",
    "but it's um it's just normal speech right so and i'm not sure if i do it well anymore or not because it was in two thousand three and um i haven't had any uh therapy since then",
    "'cause i don't stutter that badly but um i think don't finish the word for the person um that's kind of like us rude",
    "once i got used to my environment that did not happen um so my first jesus college",
    "or stop before i finish what i wanna say that is a good conversation i did i did think uh if my job would be the like same job",
    "and uh it's my perception i try not to go there as often as i did when i was young uh it did cause me an issue in college",
    "so kind of i was always speaking with them group so that was i think helped reduce the summing anxiety the audience was hard hard think",
    "uh uh uh uh and the new therapy stiles uh uh uh seems to be a trauma to me",
    "um so talking about it with family just didn't really have with a couple of my close friends i could um with my family when i would tell them i was coming to these conferences i just said i was coming to get credits for my stutter so that i could help them go for their stuttering",
    "um uh imagine i would it's altered everything so uh whether it's good or bad uh i'm thinkful now i looked back and i wasn't able to get into the military because that was the height of the iwak war i may have been killed in iwak if i got it",
    "like i wouldn't know what a nonstuttering me would even do or be you know you know the um might i have a different job possibly",
    "and uh around that time i began to spend more and more time just me and i got to a point where like therapy hadn't worked you know and i was kind of overt",
    "which is a very different mindset and uh uh uh uh and uh uh and what they seem to focus on although uh uh uh uh they seem to be a bit technical but they're also a bit technical",
    "and um i recently retired for about a year and a half ago and i still obviously still stutter",
    "absolutely i absolutely believe based on my experience uh there are still a great many more things that are available for us today but i believe the key is acceptance acceptance of yourself and how you project to others",
    "okay um my stuttering i've stuttered since i as long as i can remember sixty two years old",
    "if you are able to stutter without it anticipating the stutter and then react in the stutter and then think able to stutter afterwards there's like three moments where you can where the stutter can be disruptive but i think that stutter can happen without anticipation without reaction and without uh rumination um and so it's i think the stutter can be left long and you can concentrate on those other things",
    "it's my work situation uh i've got a bunch of friends both from where i currently live and from all of the places that i've previously lived",
    "um related to stuttering um outside of one on one new i wanna split a call if i was really anxious about job interviews and didn't know when i grew i went to pursue and i felt like stuttering is really holding me back so i just had to stutter on my own to um seek out a speech therapist and it was surprisingly difficult to find a speech therapist who worked so with teenagers who stutter",
    "so um being different in my life i don't think that much",
    "but um in what i'm in school like it's fine because you know everyone should understand right i'm also like the uh um i'm also the co chapter leader of the sanose uh national stuttering situation support group so um yeah i'm definitely more open there",
    "with desensitization and um just changing you know again my relationship with stuttering learning um you know all the tools",
    "and it's a part of some of the things we're hearing today was acceptance instead of trying to find it once you've accepted in my perception you begin to speak with more confidence it's easier and i tend to speak more fluently",
    "and it has motivated me to continue pursuing public speaking and to not try away from that because it is important to be able to do that once i become a physical therapist probably wouldn't have the great friends that i do now uh i think that it has helped me to meet a lot of people i wouldn't have ordinarily met and i think i would've really found a different path in my life because where i grew up i was around a lot of an educated individual's low social economic status and i think it was a bit altered from that day in two thousand four",
    "you need both people listen and listen to what people are saying now that they're thinking you're saying",
    "she wasn't a specialists uh that i'm stuttering even though she really cared and i think that she did a lot of kind of um her own research to try to like figure it out so you know like i felt like i was in like a really safe place with her um and you know there were times where we would be within the sessions and you know things would start stuttering and she would then uh put herself into a really safe place with her um and she would then uh put herself into a really safe place with her",
    "but anyhow um this therapist um took her extra time to learn about stuttering um and she tried her hardest to uh help and get feedback about it but she didn't have a really specific because she had a really specific because she had a really specific because she had a really specific experience",
    "'cause i don't know where i would be i don't know who i would be the person but i did not stutter",
    "uh no one knows the exact cause of stuttering you know stuttering you know you know you know stuttering um there seems to be a strong genetic link to stuttering um i have to voice",
    "um oh um oh um my spouse is also here you're here you're here um i tried at one point",
    "and then a gradually speed you up to one second a syllable half a second a syllable and then something called slow normal",
    "so it's just kind of like it's i'm just there just be a little on the i'm a little bit i seen on the um wedding cake for the firm metaphor so yeah so um i think that's positive",
    "um well i uh i went to school for anthropology yeah i've also done music",
    "you know it's really interesting sometimes i feel like i stutter i stutter more uh with my family um and sometimes with my friends as well particularly friends that i haven't seen for a while but that i you know have a very close relationship with it's like it's like i always feel like i'm kind of like a reintroducing my stuttering to them even though it's clear that uh they've always known me as",
    "then i can so um put your money where your mouth is um believe in us",
    "and um i think i get most of my techniques from what they've taught me at hollins which is uh stretch syllables and easy onsets and um i think i use those uh not like unknowingly and um i'm now looking at other uh programs",
    "and i guess just not feeling any guilt at the end of it so by that what i mean is you know not having oh i guess like gilson the word",
    "um and because there really is anything in those courses that necessarily says that my voice has to be fluent um and so every time i would give those um i would both have an excellent um feedback",
    "uh uh uh my stutter it does not impact my daily life uh uh uh uh uh all that much right now uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh",
    "but um i've always loved sequins so that kind of thing comes to mind",
    "um and then uh since at the time my stuttering originated uh with reading and so and then it obviously uh showed what i would speak to people to so um but it was i could tell that was mild where i just was able to do things to kind of hide it",
    "uh prospects um stuttering doesn't define me as person like i try not to let it",
    "so question five if you didn't stutter what might be different your life um i guess i might have been more confident than different things in my life uh",
    "uh it was hard for me to detect because he also didn't grow up in the uos to group in the philippies so english is the second language",
    "and since then i've been trying to be more opened with my stuttering talking about it for the first and sometimes i'm good at it sometimes the covert um tricks of the trade kick in",
    "um and are much more open to what i have to say it also is an amazing thing in court because judge is zero and on exactly what i'm saying and it often has actually made uh my comments towards my clients hold more ground which is really fun",
    "every one is capable of anything that they can think of right i mean just need a plan and then action so i mean uh yeah that's it i say",
    "but there was a german perception so it was kind of that was kind of fun to do it like you do it in feel great you're um at it um our i'll let's say our",
    "seemingly unrelated to stuttering whether it's uh depression or so psychological issues or other issues uh fears and other emotional things and so i feel that often my stuttering acts as like a way of connecting with people more and in that way um i do think about when i'm speaking trying to stutter as openly as possible",
    "it's helped me feel like more authentic i guess successful communication to me means just saying whatever i wanna say um for most of my life i would just not say anything",
    "and she told me these techniques you know like um easy onset and prolongation stuff but i don't really use much but i feel like i do have a slow rate of speech",
    "and it was that people environment that has cured me through my life in my career i said if i can do this the thing i dread it the most",
    "so i think um sometimes it's okay to go off script you know and let them like get get whatever they have to get off their chest",
    "but therapy can be done on your own even outside of uh the therapy room um you know community is a big part of it um and i think that even extends out to everyone else",
    "in the communication even though they or the or in the discussion even though they clearly didn't want to be having it and i thought that was really positive and at that point it didn't really matter that i stuttered or not because i was um again saying what i wanted to say communicating it in the way i wanted to say it",
    "um maybe i wouldn't be um you know like a good uh uh as good of uh the listener that i feel that i am today so like some small like changes like that i think would be different",
    "um who passed away when i was two so can't confirm it but she says he didn't also apparently his father did so i'm my great grandfather so and that's just on my mom's side of the family and one of my cousins and my dad side has a son who stutters his teenager so um i feel like there's definitely a strong genetic component",
    "went into stores and had me really go through that fear hierarchy of difficult speaking situations and i think that the desensitization piece plus me feeling like i can really trust her she was actually the first one who ever told me that it was a paida stutter and that i think was like the biggest thing in my whole life i thought it wasn't a paida just because it was something not everyone does",
    "so um but it's just kind of never getting the support from my parents and confidence to do things where i can potentially make an ask myself not really if i didn't make an ask myself uh be protected from any um bullies or anything like",
    "um so it's not something that i hide and it's not something that i try to hide but i guess i always do wish that i could be uh more fluent uh uh than what i am um my interactions with family and friends",
    "for an in service day and i think the most positive was within a minute of my the beginning of my presentation i right away said i'm a person or i'm sorry i'm a covert person who stuttered and i said it out loud to twenty five colleagues in the workshop and i said it out loud to twenty five colleagues in the workshop and i said it out loud to twenty five colleagues in the workshop and i said it out loud to twenty five colleagues in the workshop and i said it out loud to twenty five colleagues in the workshop and i said it out loud to twenty five colleagues in the workshop and i said it out loud to twenty five colleagues in the workshop and i said it out loud to twenty five colleagues in the workshop and i said it out loud to twenty five colleagues in the workshop and i said it out loud to twenty five colleagues in the workshop and i said it out loud to twenty five colleagues in the workshop and i said it out loud to twenty five colleagues in the workshop and i said it out loud to twenty five colleagues in the workshop and i said it out loud to twenty five of all right um so obviously the problem is we obviously the problem is we um so obviously the problem is we obviously the problem is we um so the problem is we um so the problem is we um so the problem is we um so the problem is we um so the problem is we um so the problem is we um so the problem is we um so the problem is we um so the problem is we um so the problem is we um so the problem is we um so the problem is we um so the problem is we um so the problem is we um so the problem is we um so the problem is we um so the problem is we um so the problem is we um so the problem is we um so the problem is we um so the problem is we um so the problem is we um so the problem is we um so the problem is we um so the problem is we um so the problem is we um so the problem is we um so the problem is we um so the problem is we um so the problem is we um so the problem is we um so the problem is we the problem is we",
    "and that was a long time ago and back then they thought i had a learning disability rather than stuttering it was my turn to read in the circle",
    "i was closer to my mother and i have two siblings and brother and a sister and i don't think i'm close to them then and long uh in school and again it uh completely affected me uh the courses i took or courses i wouldn't have to speak in",
    "um and then i think from there there is a huge impact related to learning into um just like living as a person who stutters that tends to lead to the condition getting potentially worse in but certainly more complex and that's how i think people begin to learn ways to actually make their stuttering more difficult strangely enough as they're trying to help themselves",
    "um at the nsa conference last week um there were guys in the military who stuttered uh they said that i probably just had a bad doctor that i the doctor probably had a bad day that day and just didn't wanna i don't know or maybe it was just a jerk so uh yeah so um yeah it's",
    "that's kind of a tough question because every stutterer is different and they react to specific questions differently and i've been a part of the interview project with the dallas chapter now for a few years where i have future slps talk to me um or interview me and it's always like that but also a lot of things have happened and been a part of that job and was actually quite successful",
    "for that to really sort of sink in so um yeah so that's a that's the reader's digest version of it but i could talk on that for two hours and a half",
    "but it provides me with so much entertainment and so many interesting things that i think i would i don't think i would be nearly as happy i don't think i would be nearly as full i don't think i would be as culturally confident",
    "or probably a mutation or a serious mutation somewhere down the line",
    "but help them with their goals and whatever that may be um don't force your agenda on them",
    "i didn't know why they didn't say i stuttered just in speech class",
    "so that gave me some confidence but i gave the speech to i guess a several hundred people but at the end of the speech and until this day i look back at it",
    "i mean nobody has ever told me what i can and can't say and nobody will ever prove me from",
    "to gain my confidence like confidence back so yeah i would say would just be that the two people can understand each other that is the main point",
    "the great majority of people will not be able to so uh uh uh so that's the single biggest uh uh uh criticism that i have because it just does not transfer to me any sooner or later on so that's the single biggest uh criticism that i have because it just doesn't transfer to me any sooner or later on so that's the single biggest uh criticism that i have",
    "he said i had something like a he said i have a thick tongue and a thick friendlier and he wanted me to practice some guinea i didn't find that",
    "do not interrupt them uh uh uh do not uh uh do not talk over them uh uh do not fill in their words",
    "well if i stutter what if this what if that um now days not so much",
    "so i became an engineer but uh uh to get back would i do i believe i could have been more successful had i had support earlier and there were more effective speech therapies than quite possible",
    "so i can't wait to see like really what causes that so yeah uh i was saying",
    "i went to the covert workshop as a speech pathologist i never knew what i was doing had a name so i went and i heard all the stories",
    "the fluency stuff um i don't think it did much i don't remember many ever being able to use any of it in real life or it really changed me anything but the autitudinal stuff really pushed me to start seeing my life as a stutterer instead of really seeing it as only being able to be live unless i was fluent",
    "i graduated like film and tv and like um some editing work and then just it wasn't really happy",
    "um historically my stuttering has uh prevented me or held me back and um school activities uh public activities um i've always been pretty open with my family",
    "so if i get or try to get over ninety percent of everything else but this one thing maybe it won't be so bad um but then that also maybe without stuttering it would have also changed the pressure that um was put on uh by both myself and my parents because then they're like hey why are you lacking in this",
    "um and you know in an hindio i think for my success in you know uh professionally and socially i don't know i think it probably have a much easier time than i do now but it's in a sense i'm not to um say that everything would be perfect if i didn't stutter and know there's gonna be challenges and things like that and um but um um and i guess that also to i mean one thing i've helped me just try to think about is that i'm not really sure what causes stuttering",
    "i still use stuttering and i think i had one other short term therapy after about two years after out of college um",
    "so i mean it could be genetics yeah i don't yeah i don't think there's an exact cause so if i've ever had therapy is that the question",
    "uh i am doing a master in byology so up close i looked it up uh so i know it's like gene",
    "um i would say that it has impacted my life um i when i was like younger in school i would hate to do like the overall presentation",
    "yeah um i actually was at the mall last week surveying people",
    "like i am if you don't like it oh good about it i'll tear",
    "um i guess what i do know is what didn't happen and this is more the going back to the uh question two",
    "just because i've been doing it so long um one quick example when i was waiting for my airplane on um wednesday i started talking with this couple and they we talked about where we're going",
    "that was wonderful yeah um just being able to say what you wanna say regardless if you stutter or not",
    "you know i think uh you really realize that you don't take speech for granted so you know you realize the value of being able to express yourself and you can um uh you know and i think you when you try to say things that have more meeting instead of just family",

    "but stuttering sort of breaks up all those patterns and forces people to really uh communicate with each other outside of those routines and i think that makes communication more successful because it's not done by heuristics um a recent communicative exchange was",
