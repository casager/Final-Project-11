    "but um so building in those things involving parents um i think that's probably why i had become a family therapist um",
    "when i heard that when i was young i interpreted that to mean like oh if i'm not doing it out there then i'm doing it wrong",
    "it's probably hard to miss but i always would have trouble with the old testament names the um hebrew names",
    "uh uh uh uh uh and even slow normal is still noticeably slower than most people's speech rates uh uh uh uh are you talking about therapy in general or or or or or just this particular fluency shaping",
    "and i said the national stuttering association and i said i'm a person who stutters and that for me that's like a very um and just so sometimes so rare",
    "i know that as a child um in school especially in middle and high school i would've volunteered more in class i would've given more presentations but i think that since i had therapy for it in college so when i was in college and graduate school studying speech pathology i felt like i was really able to um be open with people about my stuttering and i don't feel like now it really holds me back anymore except for maybe some very like high pressure situations",
    "oh so when i was little kinda how much earlier had a lot of questions doubts",
    "um so i think that a good friend of mine one time said that you know what's really cool about and it came outta nowhere we weren't even talking about stuttering per se we were just talking about like we hadn't seen each other in a long time this was a friend from high school and he kinda said he goes you know it seems like you having to deal with this and he said this he didn't say stuttering but he said you having to deal with this really gave you a purpose that a lot of other people don't get and i guess i'd thought about it that way but you don't always you know your acquaintances and your friends you don't really always say those kinds of things to each other i think especially perhaps men",
    "not at you yeah ooh what causes stuttering",
    "like i would intentionally tell the teacher and luckily they're they don't force me until i was about in high school they respect that",
    "okay so currently um i am about to transition into um year so i'm in the midst of job hunting and um and so i'm busy with that so um and finishing up the last bit of school",
    "hmm uh i assume it's genetic uh it's probably a physiological uh thing both mind and body uh uh i've heard some um uh uh maybe uh your transmitters aren't from your brain aren't sending the right messages to your muscles",
    "like a speech impediment with like language and then i guess i was a late talker too and then everything just builds up and then i put in like fillers too as you can hear",
    "um so i did therapy i did not appreciate it really much what has helped me is to meet other people who is who stutter",
    "uh but my brother i think had practiced a lot of that and it's just now he's learned to word swap i think that's his biggest tool is just changing out those words that he knows he's gonna have a block on for a young stutterer the message that i would give them is something that i wish i had done as a teenager",
    "and i just stayed on the phone and kept saying you will refund this money now or else you're going to have to be dealing with the federal government like agency i'm blanking on the name right now that will oh uh the fcc will be dealing with this and you will have to deal with my bank and you will have to deal with my credit card company and they kept trying to put me off like make better offers and i really thought that was great",
    "and just any um like support group that empowers like kids and teens and adults who stutter and just make sure that people know that like stuttering doesn't have to hold them back and like it's okay to stutter",
    "and uh biofeedback was just starting to come out so worked on biofeedback relaxation skills",
    "i think it's definitely um i mean i'm like i don't work in the field and i guess i'm pretty conscious about like the terminology i use but just kind of like it is uh from what i can assess of it it is a disorder that the brain has and that impacts everything else and so um and during my lived experience i think of just uh waking up one day and having stuttering be there uh waking up one day and having stuttering be gone",
    "and i commend you for having the compassion to be able to help people because you the impact that a speech language pathologist can make on a stutterer is huge but also on the parents of a stutterer and i think that's something else to where uh the parents need to also have some people to talk to",
    "well let me see if it was i know i've stuttering for as long as i can remember when i was in grade school i we were they put us they put me in a speech class",
    "so everything i've read and i've think i've probably read as much as any person who just stutters and so i'm i believe the that it's a physiological cause",
    "or i guess not everyone probably a natural distribution of people if you hate it like it probably be in the middle somewhere",
    "which is only the third one in the entire world and it was formed for the purpose of those who stutter i'm going to cut this off",
    "oh um i wanna say everything but i feel like it would be everything in terms of actual things i feel like be everything in terms of intensity i would just be able to express myself more i'd probably be able to enjoy life more have a much stronger zest for it um",
    "cause when i talk to people i know well i stutter less oh and with strangers i stutter more uh also i don't stutter when i whisper or sing or when i'm uh uh uh like angry i don't  yeah so",
    "well i think it's definitely genetic because my dad has a stutter um i confirmed that with him i wanna say maybe a year ago and so his um speech pattern is like mine",
    "and friends but not about my stuttering uh uh it's always been a taboo like topic um but um recently uh i've been a part of the nsa",
    "like if the world was like the nsa i think stuttering would sound and look different um i don't think the way we speak is directly written in our genes or in our brains i think it always interacts with where we're living i had speech therapy when i was really young",
    "or gone to a speech therapy and it was um i thought it was very ineffective you know the time i didn't know what to expect",
    "something in and uh he was able to prove when we stuttered a spoke into delayed auditory feedback machine we spoke with fluency",
    "well i have already achieved a lot of success but it was a struggle at each way and there were some things i didn't do because of my stuttering",
    "um just in general i guess when i feel that the person i'm speaking with that we're understanding each other we're on the same wavelength and uh there isn't that sort of confusion where we're not quite sure what the other person is saying and even with a stutter that's possible but it can be obviously more challenging",
    "and um i think that we both need to give ourselves a break uh because i think that people who stutter are probably harder on themselves than you know some other folks who are you know probably dealing with things that are uh very similar but not as clearly obvious to the outside world um and i think that the world uh uh would do better to learn more about us",
    "for it started for my articulation uh i think i had a lot of speech sound errors and i remember while i was in therapy for articulation i developed my stuttering and i don't remember much speech therapy targeting my stuttering i remember mostly about articulation like practicing saying certain sounds and you know working up to saying them in sentences and things",
    "with a speech pathologist who specialized in stuttering and i saw her for about a year and a half and that was a good experience we i would say half the therapy was fluency type stuff and half of it was attitudinal and sort of changing my perceptions of stuttering and facing my fears",
    "we moved from this the urban part of where i lived to the more suburban part of where i live from the city of poughkeepsie to the town of poughkeepsie when i was in middle school in sixth grade and i told my parents i was tired of the speech therapy i didn't wanna do it anymore and then didn't receive therapy again until high school",
    "but when she was talking about this in the group um i said i'm glad you stayed because you didn't let her win if i didn't stutter i don't think anything would be different um because i have my own problems that i've dealt with personal problems uh with talking to people",
    "um so yeah so okay i think that's it for question two um question three",
    "you know uh uh to uh become an uh emt you know um um um the instructors um they said that my speech could have been a you know you know problem um in hindsight it might have been a problem or not",
    "a lot of people i had contacted worked with like preschoolers which didn't help me but i was very fortunate that i found a great slp she did a combination of like a lot of counseling acceptance like desensitization work with some i would say fluency sheet being a stuttering modification like throwing a big emphasis on it like being okay to stutter and stuttering openly as well",
    "but that was the only feedback that i got from her um and so i think that like while it wasn't directed towards my stuttering per se i feel like it did help me read more effectively like out loud",
    "it's not weighing me down it's on my hip it's on my side",
    "tell people that you stutter and meet other people who stutter i think that's the most important thing so you don't feel alone um they should just accept it they should not finish uh what i'm about to say they should um just behave like it's a normal thing um",
    "and tell for example uh tell your teacher and your colleagues and your uh uh the people around you that you stutter so they know what it is and that they don't think that you're weird or anything um i'm not sure i answered the question but uh um",
    "um um well i'm about to say you know here at this meeting but that's a bit it's not really a good answer um but i think that's the best answer i can give um yeah but i don't know",
    "you know and outside of college i really haven't had speech therapy because it costs a lot of money successful communication is when you can get your message across to the person that you are speaking to",
    "and uh that was pretty annoying because uh they had me reading to parent volunteers the whole wizard of oz books",
    "primarily my mother this is kind of where what i try and say and what she hears are two different things um can i give a positive example of a communication can you give an example of a positive so um can you give an example of a positive communicative experience um i think my going through my mba program and just kind of having a presentation for every class and like where you have to get into suits and just do that and that was kind of fun it was if anything that program gave me more confidence that i could stuff sure i'll",
    "sometimes i wonder if this is actually something that occurred because of the stuttering or is it because i held myself back my answer now is that it's because i held myself back i don't think this had to happen",
    "and i personally don't think that's ever going to happen you know in the like like like physical i'm going to take a pill",
    "and you know it's still here so i mean yeah i think just conveying your point in a competent way",
    "um went through it in a very organic way because i kinda forgot that i was seeing a speech therapist which was good um but again she had she did not detect anything um in any activity although the only thing that she said was when i was reading she told me that at times i was reading too fast",
    "i just won six hundred million dollars can't you tell how happy i am no",
    "but my friends are pretty good cool with that so they let me talk too so",
    "um you know uh that i could choose from uh to address uh stuttering in the way that i see um best",
    "it not a lot of change uh successful communication means um that uh developed an understanding uh with my audience or person",
    "i'm not put off by it but then there's stuttering and there's stuttering and there's stuttering and then there's the speech impairment uh successful communication means essentially to me",
    "is stepping outside of our comfort zone joining clubs joining activities that forced me to speak so i did a lot of that when i was at howard",
    "it's an educational process about stuttering what do i think causes stuttering well i know a little bit more than just the average person that",
    "but um it's just normal speech right so uh and i'm not sure if i do it well anymore or not because it was in two thousand and three and um i haven't had any uh therapy since then",
    "'cause i don't stutter that badly but um i think don't finish the word for the person um that's kind of i guess rude",
    "once i got acclimated to my new environment that did not happen um so my first years of college",
    "or stop before i finish what i wanna say that is a good conversation i did think uh if my job will be there like same job",
    "and uh that's my perception i try not to go there as often as i did when i was young it did cause me an issue in college",
    "so kind of i was always speaking with a known group so that was that seemed to help reduce some anxiety the audience was the hard part of the",
    "and that uh uh and the new therapy styles uh uh uh style uh uh uh uh seem to be a different paradigm uh in that the goal is not making you fluent the goal is making you an easier stutterer",
    "um so talking about it with family just didn't really happen with a couple of my close friends i could um with my family when i would tell them i was coming to these conferences i just said i was coming to get credits for my certification",
    "um uh i imagine i would it's altered everything so uh whether it's good or bad i'm thankful now i look back and i wasn't in able to get into the military 'cause that was the height of the iraq war i may have been killed in iraq if i got in",
    "like i wouldn't know what a non stuttering me would even do or you know you know be um might i have a different job possibly",
    "and uh around that time i began to spend more and more time just me and i got to a point where like therapy hadn't worked you know and i was kind of over it",
    "which is a very different mindset uh uh uh uh and what uh they seem to focus on uh uh uh uh although uh uh all i know is from just talking to people",
    "and um i recently retired for about a year and a half ago and i still obviously still stutter",
    "i absolutely believe based on my experience uh there's still a great many more things that are available for us today but i believe the key is acceptance acceptance of yourself and how you project to others",
    "okay um my stuttering i i've stuttered since i as long as i can remember sixty two years old",
    "if you are able to stutter without it anticipating the stutter and then reacting to the stutter and then thinking about the stutter afterwards there's like three moments where you can where the stutter can be disruptive but i think that stutter can happen without anticipation without reaction and without uh rumination um and so it's i think the stutter can be left alone and you can concentrate on those other things",
    "with my work situation uh i've got uh bunch of friends both from where i currently live and from all of the places that i've previously lived",
    "um related to stuttering um plus i knew i wanted to go to college but i was really anxious about job interviews and didn't know career i wanted to pursue and i felt like stuttering was really holding me back so i decided on my own to um seek out a speech therapist and it was surprisingly difficult to find a speech therapist who works with teenagers who stutter",
    "so um something different in my life i don't think that much",
    "but um in when i'm in school like it's fine because i mean everyone should understand right i'm also like the uh i'm also the cochapter leader of the san jose uh national stuttering association support group so um yeah i'm definitely more open there",
    "with desensitization and um just changing you know again my relationship with stuttering learning um you know all the tools",
    "and it's a part of some of the things we're hearing today with acceptance instead of trying to fight it once you've accepted it in my perception you begin to speak with more confidence it's easier and i tend to speak more fluently",
    "and it has motivated me to continue pursuing public speaking and to not shy away from that because it is important to be able to do that once i become a physical therapist probably wouldn't have the great friends that i do now uh i think that it has helped me to meet a lot of people i wouldn't have ordinarily met and i think i would have really followed a different path in my life because where i grew up i was around a lot of uneducated individuals low socioeconomic status and i think it actually helped me in the long run",
    "you need both people to listen and listen to what people are saying not what they're thinking they're saying",
    "she wasn't a specialist uh there in stuttering even though she really cared and i think that she did a lot of kind of um um her own research to try to like figure it out so i you know like i felt like i was in like a really safe place with her um and you know there were times where we would be within the sessions and you know things would start to uh to sound more fluent but you know it never uh was a cure all",
    "but anyhow this therapist she took her extra time to learn about stuttering um and she tried her hardest to uh help and get feedback from me um and then high school therapist she was kind of had the same attitude",
    "'cause i don't know where i would be i don't know who i would be as a person if i did not stutter",
    "uh no one knows the exact cause of you know you know you know stuttering um there seems to be a strong genetic link to stuttering um i have two boys",
    "pardon oh um oh um my spouse is also here you'll hear um i tried at one point",
    "and then they gradually speed you up to one second a syllable half a second a syllable and then something called slow normal",
    "so it was just kind of like it's I'm just there to be a little bit icing on the um wedding cake for the for metaphor so yeah so i think that's a positive",
    "um well uh i went to school for anthropology and i've also done music",
    "you know it's really interesting sometimes i feel like i stutter more uh with my family um and sometimes with my friends as well particularly friends that i haven't seen for a while but that i you know have a very close relationship with it's like i always feel like i'm kind of like uh reintroducing uh my stuttering to them even though it's clear that uh they've always known me as",
    "then i can so um put your money where your mouth is um believe in us",
    "and um i think i get most of my techniques from what they've taught me at hollins which is a stretch syllable and easy onsets and um i think i use those uh not like unknowingly and um i'm now looking at other uh programs",
    "and i guess just not feeling any guilt at the end of it so by that what i mean is you know not having well i guess like guilt isn't the word",
    "um because there really isn't anything in those courses that necessarily says that my voice has to be fluent and so every time i would give those um i would both have excellent feedback",
    "uh my stutter uh does not impact my daily life uh uh uh life all that much right now uh uh uh in that i'm uh uh i'm uh uh very happy",
    "but um uh i've always loved sequencing so that kinda thing comes to mind",
    "um and then uh since at the time my stuttering originated uh with reading and so and then it obviously uh showed when i would speak to people too so uh but it was i couldn't tell if i was mild or i just was able to do things to kinda hide it",
    "uh prospects um stuttering doesn't define me as a person like i don't i try not to let it",
    "so question five if you didn't stutter what might be different in your life um i guess i might have been more confidence in different things in my life uh",
    "uh it was hard for me to detect because he also didn't grow up in the us he grew up in the philippines so english is a second language",
    "and since then i've been trying to be more opened with my stuttering talking about it for the first and sometimes i'm good at it sometimes the covert um tricks of the trade kick in",
    "um and are much more open to what i have to say it also is an amazing thing in court because judges zero in on exactly when they see what i'm saying and often has actually made uh my comments towards my clients hold more ground which is really fun",
    "everyone is capable of anything that they can think of right i mean you just you need a plan and then action so i mean uh yeah that's it i'd say",
    "but there was the adrenaline rush and so it was kind of that was kind of fun to do where it was like you do it and you feel great you're um i had an um let's say hour",
    "seemingly unrelated to stuttering whether it's uh depression or psychological issues or other issues uh fears and other emotional things and so i feel that often my stuttering acts as like a way of connecting with people more and in that way um i do think about when i'm speaking trying to stutter as openly as possible",
    "it's helped me feel like more authentic i guess successful communication to me means just saying whatever i wanna say um for most of my life i would just not say anything",
    "and she taught me these techniques you know like um easy onset and prolongations and stuff but i don't really use it much but i feel like i do have a slower rate of speech",
    "and it was that pivotal moment that has carried me through my life and my career i said i if i can do this the thing i dreaded the most",
    "so i think um so sometimes it's okay to go off script you know and let them like get whatever they have to get off their chest",
    "but therapy can be done on your own even outside of the therapy room um you know community is a big part of it um and i think that even extends out to everyone else",
    "in the communication even though they the or the or in the discussion even though they clearly didn't wanna be having it and i thought that was really positive and at that point it didn't really matter that i stuttered or not 'cause i was um again saying what i wanted to say communicating it in the way i wanted to say it",
    "um maybe i wouldn't be um you know like a good uh uh as good of a listener that i feel that i am today so like some small like changes like that i think would be different",
    "um who passed away when i was two so can't confirm it but she says he did and also apparently his father did so my great grandfather so and that's just on my mom's side of the family and one of my cousins on my dad's side has a son who stutters who's a teenager so um i feel like there's definitely a strong genetic component",
    "went to stores and had me really go through that fear hierarchy of difficult speaking situations and i think that the desensitization piece plus me feeling like i could really trust her she was actually the first one who ever told me that it was okay to stutter and that i think was like the biggest thing 'cause my whole life i thought it wasn't okay just because it was something not everyone does",
    "so um but it's just kind of never getting the support from my parents and confidence to do things where i could potentially make an ass of myself not realize if i did make an ass of myself i would be protected from any um bullies or anything like that",
    "um so it's not something that i hide and it's not something that i try to hide but i guess i always do wish that i could be uh more fluent uh uh than what i am um my interactions with family and friends",
    "for an in service day and i think the most positive was within a minute of my the beginning of my presentation i right away said i am a person or i'm sorry i'm a covert person who stutters and i said it out loud to twenty five colleagues in the workshop",
    "and that was a long time ago and back then they thought i had a learning disability rather than stuttering i was it was my turn to read in the circle",
    "i was closer to my mother and i have two siblings a brother and a sister and i don't think i'm close to them at all uh school and again it uh completely affected me um the courses i took were courses i wouldn't have to speak in",
    "um and then i think from there there's a huge impact related to learning and to um just like living as a person who stutters that tends to lead to the condition getting potentially worsened but certainly more complex and that's how i think people begin to learn ways to actually make their stuttering more difficult strangely enough as they're trying to help themselves",
    "um at the nsa conference last week um there were guys in the military who stuttered uh they said that i probably just had a bad doctor that i the doctor was probably having a bad day that day and just didn't wanna i don't know or maybe he was just a jerk so uh yeah so um yeah it's",
    "that's kind of a tough question because every stutterer is different and they react to specific questions differently and i've been a part of the interview project with the dallas chapter now for a few years where i have future slps talk to me um or interview me and it's always the same ten questions and you can give them advice at the end",
    "for that to really sort of sink in um um yeah so that's a that's the reader's digest version of it but i could talk on that for two hours and a half",
    "but it provides me with so much entertainment and so many interesting things that i think i would i don't think i would be nearly as happy i don't think i would be nearly as fulfilled i don't think i would be as culturally confident",
    "or probably a mutation or a series of mutations somewhere down the line okay",
    "but help them with their goals and whatever that may be um don't force your agenda on them",
    "i didn't know why they didn't say i stuttered it was just a speech class",
    "so that gave me some confidence but i gave the speech to i guess several hundred people but at the end of the speech and until this day i look back at it",
    "i mean nobody has ever told me what i can and can't say and nobody ever will prevent me from saying what i want my impression is that stuttering has always been genetic i have not done any genealogy research",
    "to gain my like confidence back so yeah i would say would just be that if two people can understand each other that is the main point",
    "the great majority of people will not be able to uh uh uh uh so that's the single biggest uh uh uh as to criticism that i have because it just does not transfer to the outside world",
    "he said i had some he like a he said i had a thick tongue and a thick frenulum and he wanted me to practice some quacky technique i didn't buy into that",
    "do not interrupt them uh uh uh uh uh uh do not talk over them uh uh do not fill in their words",
    "what if i stutter what if this and what if that um nowadays not so much",
    "so i became an engineer but i uh to get back to it i do i believe i could have been more successful had i had support earlier and there were more effective speech therapies then quite possible",
    "so i can't wait to see like really what causes that so yeah uh i would say",
    "i went to the covert workshop as a speech pathologist i never knew what i was doing had a name so i went and i heard all the stories",
    "the fluency stuff um i don't think it did much i don't remember many ever being able to use any of it in real life or it really changing anything but the attitudinal stuff really pushed me to start seeing my life as a stutterer instead of really seeing it as only being able to be lived unless i if i was fluent",
    "i graduated in like like film and tv and like um some editing work and then just i wasn't really happy",
    "um historically my stuttering has uh prevented me or held me back in um school activities uh public activities um i've always been pretty open with my family",
    "so if i get if i try to get over ninety percent on everything else but this one thing maybe it won't be so bad but then um but then that also maybe without stuttering it would've also changed the pressure that um was put on uh by both myself and my parents because then they're like hey why are you lacking in this",
    "um and it you know and yeah i think with my success in you know uh professionally and socially i think i'd probably much easier time than i do now but it's not to um say that everything would be perfect if i didn't stutter and you know there'll still be challenges and things like that and um but um um and i guess also too uh mean i one thing i've been that helps me to think about positive experiences um that i had that i wouldn't have had if i didn't stutter",
    "i still use to this day and then i think i had one other short term therapy after about two years after out of of college um",
    "so i mean it could be genetics yeah i don't think there's an exact cause so if i've ever had therapy is that the question",
    "uh i am doing a master in biology so of course i looked it up uh so i know it's like gene",
    "um i will say that it has impacted my life um i when i was like younger in school i will hate to do like the oral presentation",
    "i don't know um i actually was at the mall last week surveying people",
    "like that's how i am if you don't like it well go to hell i don't care",
    "um i guess what i do know is what didn't happen and this is more of me going back to the uh question two",
    "just because i've been doing it so long um one quick example when i was waiting for my airplane on um wednesday i i started talking with this couple and they we uh talked about where we were going",
    "that was wonderful yeah um just being able to say what you wanna say regardless if you stutter or not",
    "you know i think uh you really realize that you don't take speech for granted so you know you realize the value of being able to express yourself and you can um uh you know and i think you when you try to say things that have more meaning instead of just rambling",
    "know um i personally i have had a lot of emotional problems and concepts that existed for a long time because i didn't really have speech therapy you know so just please keep in mind that you have to treat the speech problems that the person has",
    "wasn't about uh using techniques which i did learn and relearn but more about accepting the fact that i stutter",
    "i hated being there for it i did the therapy i did all the exercises the night before and she kind of knew it and i really hated how i sounded and then in high school i wanted do something different and i wanted to change myself",
    "but stuttering sort of breaks up all those patterns and forces people to really uh communicate with each other outside of those routines and i think that makes communication more successful 'cause it's not bound by heuristics um a recent communicative exchange that was successful was",
    "so um yes i did when i was younger",
    "um in my daily life it doesn't have an impact on me um because i don't allow it to have an impact on me um uh i think it's worse in my job uh where i talk to customers um and they don't know that i stutter and i have to be you know very professional",
    "the graduate school i went to purdue offered therapy for free to its students and i went there and that was actually a good experience uh the first guy i saw was probably good but i didn't think i was ready for it",
    "okay i'm gonna end it here and start a different file for each of the six questions what do you think causes stuttering i've always assumed there was a genetic component to it",
    "um it just happens to take us a bit longer to talk um yeah",
    "you know know the terminology um know what people struggle with um three like never forget that yes like there are people who stutter but they're more than just their stutter too",
    "the stuttering will lessen on its that's something i've learned myself i didn't learn that until i was really really when i reached middle years",
    "and why how of does that work uh i know that we do not all of them yet",
    "so i've had tremendous outcomes through avoidance reduction therapy sure so successful communication to me means that other people understand you and you're able to convey your messages in a way that's enjoyable for both parties",
    "i mean for me i don't really have to speculate because for you know the first eighteen years of my life i didn't stutter and um uh and since i know it i just compare myself uh to the way i was then and the way i was now and you know i was so much more confident and i had a lot more of a social life then and uh you know kind especially when i got to college and started stuttering i mean i lost a lot of that and so it's now it's kind of a matter of trying to get that all back"

  "hypotheses": [
    " but um so building in those things involving parents um i think that's partly why i had become a better therapist um",
    " when i heard that when i was young i interpreted that to me in like all if i'm not doing it out there then i'm doing it wrong",
    " or you heard nice but it i always would have trouble with the all testament names the um pver names",
    " uh uh uh uh uh uh and even slow normal is still noticeably slower than most people's speech rates uh uh uh uh uh uh uh are you talking about therapy in general or uh uh uh uh uh uh and you're talking about therapy in general or uh uh uh uh uh and you're talking about therapy in general or uh uh uh uh uh uh and you're talking about therapy in general or uh uh uh uh uh uh and you're talking about therapy in general or uh uh uh uh uh uh and you're talking about therapy in general or uh uh uh uh uh uh and you're talking about therapy in general or uh uh uh uh uh uh uh and you're talking about therapy in general or uh uh uh uh uh uh uh and you're talking about therapy in general or uh uh uh uh uh uh uh and you're talking about therapy in general or uh uh uh uh uh uh uh and you're talking about therapy in general or uh uh uh uh uh uh uh and you're talking about therapy in general or uh uh uh uh uh uh uh and you're talking about therapy in general or uh uh uh uh uh uh uh and you're talking about therapy in general or uh uh uh uh uh uh and you're talking about therapy in general or uh uh uh uh uh uh uh and you're talking about therapy in general or uh uh uh uh uh uh and you're talking about therapy in general or uh uh uh uh uh uh and you're talking about therapy in general or uh uh uh uh uh and you're talking about therapy in general or uh uh uh uh uh and you're talking about the same thing that's going to be or as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as",
    " and i said the national stuttering association and i said i'm a person who stutters and that's for me that's like a very um and just sometimes a rare",
    " i know that as a child um in school especially in middle and high school i would have volunteered more in class i would have given more presentations but i think that since had therapy for in college so what i was in college and graduate school studying speech pathology about like i was really able to um be open with people about my stuttering and i don't feel like now it really holds me back anymore except for maybe some that i was not really sure but i think that in the end i would have learned about my stuttering and i would have learned that as a child i would have learned that as a child i would have learned that as a child in school especially in middle and high school i would have thought about my school and i would have thought about my presentation but i think that since had therapy for in college so what i was in college and graduate school studying speech pathology about like i was really able to um be open with people about my stuttering",
    " oh so when i was little it kind of had much earlier i had a lot of questions about",
    " um so i think that a good friend of mine one time said that you know what's really cool about and it came out of nowhere where we weren't even talking about stuttering per se we were just talking about like we hadn't seen each other in a long time this was a friend from high school and he kinda said he goes you know it seems like you having to deal with this and he said to see and say stuttering but he said you having to deal with this really gave you a purpose that a lot of other people don't get and i guess i thought about it that way but you don't always say that you know what's important and it's not just about the person that you know what's important but it's about the person that you know what's important and it's not just about the person that's talking to you",
    " yeah ooh we cause the stuttering",
    " like i have actually some of the teacher and luckily they didn't reinforce me so i was quite nice with them to respect that",
    " okay so currently really um i am about to transition into um um uh uh uh uh uh year so i'm in the that stuff job thing um and so i'm so i'm a definitely um thing to maintain and uh and so i'm a really important thing to maintain",
    " um uh i i assumed it's genetic uh it's probably a physiological uh thing could both of my and my body uh uh i've heard um uh um uh maybe uh your transmitters aren't well from it bring on harnesses or something",
    " like a speech impediment with like language and then i guess i was a late talker too and then everything just built up and then i put in like fillers too as you could hear",
    " um so i did therapy i did not appreciate it really much what has helped me is to meet other people who stutter",
    " uh but my brother i think had practiced a lot of that and it's just now he's learned towards swap and i think that's his biggest tool is just changing out those words that he knows he's gonna have a block on for a young stutter the message that i would give them is something that i wish i had done as a teenager",
    " and i just stayed on the phone and kept saying you will refund this money now or else you're going to have to be dealing with the federal government like agency i'm blinking on the name right now that will the FCC will be dealing with this and you will have to deal with my bank and you will have to deal with my credit card company and they kept trying to put me off like make better offers and i really thought that was great",
    " and just any um like support group that empowers like kids and teens and adults who stutter and just make sure that people know that like stuttering doesn't have to hold the back and like it's okay to stutter",
    " and uh by a feedback was just starting to come out so worked on by feedback relaxation skills",
    " i think it's definitely um i mean i'm like i don't work in feel and i guess i'm pretty conscious about like the turnology i use but just kind of like it is uh from what i think and associated it is it is a disorder that the brain has and that impacts everything else and so um and through my lint experience i think you're just uh waking up one day and having stuttering be there uh wake up one day and having stuttering be gone",
    " and i can convince you for having the compassion to be able to help people because you the impact that a speech language pathologist can make on a stutterer is huge but also on the parents of a stutterer and i think that's something else where uh the parents need to also have some people to talk to",
    " well let's see if was i know i'm a stuttering for as long as i can remember when i was in grade school they put a speech class in a speech class",
    " so everything i've read and i think i've probably read as much as any person i do stutters and i believe that it's a physiological cause",
    " i guess not everyone probably at natural just just your people if you hate it like it probably be in the middle somewhere",
    " which is only the third one in the entire world and it was formed for the purpose of those who stutter and it cut this off",
    " uh um i wanna say everything but i don't feel like it would be everything in terms of the actual things i feel like it would be everything in terms of intense intensity i would just be able to express myself more or i probably be able to enjoy it like more have a much stronger zest for it uh",
    " people uh i know well uh i stutter less oh and with strangers i stutter more uh also so i don't stutter less when i was with expert or stutter less and i don't know how to make a phone call or to make a phone call",
    " well i think it's definitely genetic because my dad has a stutter um i confirm that with him on to say maybe a year ago and so his um speech pattern is like mine",
    " and friends but not about my stuttering it's always been a taboo like topic um but um recently uh i've been a part of the nsa",
    " like if the world was like the nsa i think stuttering would sound and look different um i don't think the way we speak is directly written in our genes or in our brains i think it always interacts with where it's really me i had speech therapy when i was really young",
    " gone to speech therapy and it was um i thought it was very effective the time i didn't know what to expect",
    " something and uh he was able to prove when we stuttered spoke into a delayed auditory feedback machine we spoke with fluency",
    " well i've already achieved a lot of success but it was a struggle at each way and there were some things i didn't do because of my stuttering",
    " um just in general i guess when i feel that the person i'm speaking with that we're understanding each other and we're on the same way of life and uh there's not sort of confusion or not question with the other person saying and even with stutter that's possible but it can be more challenging",
    " and um i think that we both need to give ourselves a break um because i think that people who stutter are probably harder on themselves than you know some other folks who are you know probably dealing with things that are um very similar but not as clearly obviously to the outside world um and i think that the world would uh uh would do better to than we can have some other people in a more positive way and better approach the world and then there's a lot of things that we can't do so far",
    " for it started for my now articulation i uh i think i had a lot of speech sound errors and i remember while i was in therapy for articulation i developed my stuttering and i don't remember much speech therapy targeting my stuttering i remember mostly about articulation like practicing saying certain sounds and you know working up to say them in sentences and things",
    " with a speech pathologist who specialized in stuttering and i saw her for about a year and a half and that was a good experience we i would say half the therapy was fluency type stuff and half of it was addeditudinal and changing the perceptions of stuttering and phasing my fear",
    " we moved from this the urban part of where i live to the more subeverything part of where i live from the city of it gets you to do the town of it kept you when i was in middle school in sixth grade and i told my parents i was tired of speech there to do it anymore and then didn't receive therapy again until high school",
    " but when she was talking about this in the group um i said i'm glad you stayed because you didn't let her win if i didn't stutter i don't think anything would be different um because i have my own problems that i've dealt with personal problems with and i'm not really sure what you want to get out of here but i think it's okay that i'm not really sure what you want to get out is out and i think it's okay",
    " um so yeah so okay i think i think i's no for question two um question three",
    " to you know to become an um um um um um um um um t you know t um um um the instructors um um the instructors um the instructors um the instructors um the instructors um the instructors um the instructors um the instructors um the instructors um the instructors um the instructors um the instructors um the instructors um the instructors um the instructors um the instructors um the instructors um the instructors um the instructors um the instructors um the instructors um the instructors um the instructors um the instructors um the instructors um the instructors um the instructors um the instructors um the instructors um the instructors um the instructors um the instructors um the instructors um the instructors um the instructors um the instructors um the instructors um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um the instructor um t you know t you you know t you you know t you you know t you you know t you you know t you you know t um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um t um t um t um t um t um t um t um t um t um t um t um t um t um t um t um t um t um t um t um t um t um t um t um t um t um t um t um t um t um t um t um t",
    " a lot of people contacted me to work with like preschoolers which in howling but i was very fortunate that i found a great slp she did a combination of like a lot of counseling acceptance like desensitization work with um i would say like fluency shaping and stuttering modification like very but like a big effort is on it like being okay to stutter and stuttering openly as well",
    " but that was the only feedback that i got from her um and so i think that like while it wasn't directed towards my stuttering person i feel like it did help me read more effectively like out loud",
    " it's not weighing me down it's on my hip it's on my side",
    " still people that you stutter and meet other people who stutter i think that's the most important thing so you don't feel hello um they should just accept that at the end you not finish what i'm about to say and they should um just behave like it's a normal thing um",
    " and until you're teaching your colleagues and your people around you that you're stuttering so they know what it is and they don't think that you're doing anything um i'm not sure i answer the question but um",
    " um um um um well i'm about to say you know here at this meeting but that's a bit it's not really good answer um i think the answer i can give um yeah but i don't know i'm not sure but i think i've had a lot of fun",
    " you know and outside of college i really haven't had speech therapy because it costs a lot of money successful communication it is when you can get your message across to the person that you are speaking to",
    " and uh that was pretty annoying because they had uh they had to be reading to parents and volunteers the whole Wizard of Oz books",
    " Carmly like my mother is just kind of where what i try and say and what she hears are two different things um can i give a positive example of a communicative example of a for work and visit so um can you give an example of a positive communicative experience um can i think why going through my heavy a program and just go home and talk to my heavy a program and just come home and have a good one and have fun",
    " sometimes i wonder if this is actually something that i trade because stuttering or is it because i help my self back my answer now is that it's because i helped my self back i don't think this had to happen",
    " and i probably don't think that's ever gonna happen you know in the like like like like physical i'm here going to think of bill",
    " and you know it's still here so yeah and yeah i think you just conveying your point in a competence way",
    " um went through it in a very organic way because i kind of forgot that i was seeing a speech therapist which was good um but again she did not detect anything um in any activity although the only thing that she said was when i was reading she told me that at times i was reading too fast",
    " i just won six hundred million dollars can't you tell how happy i am no",
    " but my friends are pretty good cool with that so they let me talk to so",
    " um you know uh that i could choose from uh to uh just uh stuttering in the way that i see uh the best",
    " but not a lot of change uh successful communication means um that i developed an understanding uh with my audience or person",
    " i'm not put off by it but then they're stuttering and stuttering and then there's a speech impaired uh successful communication means essentially fluent to me",
    " is stepping outside of our comfort zone joining clubs stuttering activities that forced me to speak so i did a lot of that what i was at howard",
    " it's an educational process about stuttering where i think causes stuttering well i know a little bit more than just as a person it",
    " but it's um it's just normal speech right so and i'm not sure if i do it well anymore or not because it was in two thousand three and um i haven't had any therapy since then",
    "'cause i don't stutter that badly but um i think don't finish the word for the person um that's kind of i guess rude",
    " once i got used accolades to my environment that did not happen um so my my first piece of college",
    " or stop stop be be for i finish what i wanna say that is a good conversation i did i did think uh if my job would be the like same job",
    " and uh it's my perception i try not to go there as often as i did when i was young uh it did cause me an issue in college",
    " so kind of i was always speaking with no group so that was i think helped reduce so many anxiety the audience was hard part",
    " and uh uh uh uh uh and the new therapy styles uh uh uh uh aisles uh uh uh seemed to you you seemed to be a fun thing to me",
    " um so talking about it with family just didn't really happen with a couple of my close friends i could um with my family when i would tell them i was coming to these conferences i just said i was coming to get credits for the conference for the second time",
    " um uh i imagine i would it's altered everything so uh whether it's good or bad uh i'm thinkful now i look back and i wasn't equal to getting into the military because that was the height of the Iraq war i may have been killed in Iraq if i got it",
    " like i wouldn't know what a nonstuttering me would even do or be you know you know be um might i have a different job possibly",
    " and uh around that time i began to spend more and more time just me and i got to a point where like therapy hadn't worked you know and i was kind of over it",
    " which is a a very different mindset and uh uh uh uh uh uh and what they uh uh uh uh they seemed to focus on although uh uh uh uh and what they seemed to focus on although uh uh uh uh and what they seemed to focus on although uh uh uh uh uh and what they seemed to focus on although uh uh uh uh uh and what they seemed to focus on although uh uh uh uh uh uh and what they seemed to focus on although although uh uh uh uh uh and what they seemed to focus on although uh uh uh uh uh and what they seemed to focus on although uh uh uh uh uh and what they seemed to focus on although uh uh uh uh uh and what they seemed to focus on although uh uh uh uh and what they seemed to focus on although although uh uh uh uh and what they seemed to focus on although uh uh uh uh and what they seemed to focus on although uh uh uh and what they seemed to focus on although uh uh uh uh and what they seemed to focus on although uh uh uh uh and what they seemed to focus on although uh uh uh and what they seemed to focus on although uh uh uh uh and what they seemed to focus on although uh uh uh and what they seemed to focus on although uh uh uh and what they seemed to focus on although uh uh uh and what they seemed to focus on",
    " and um i recently retired about a year and a half ago and i still stutter",
    " absolutely i absolutely believe based on my experience uh there are still a great many more things that are available for us today but i believe the key is acceptance acceptance of yourself and how you project others",
    " okay um my stuttering i've stuttered since i can as long as i can remember sixty two years old",
    " if you are able to stutter without it anticipating the stutter i'm then reacting to stuttering and then thinking about the stutter afterwards there's like three moments where the stutter can be disruptive but i think that stutter can happen without anticipation without reaction and without a combination um and so it's i think the stutter can be left alone and you can concentrate on those other things",
    " with my i work situation uh i've got a a a a a a bunch of friends both from where i currently live and from all of the places that i've previously lived",
    " um really stuttering um past i went on new i wanted to go to college but was really anxious about job interviews and to know can i career i want to pursue when i felt like stuttering was really holding me back so i decided on my own to um seek out a speech therapist then it was surprisingly difficult to find a speech therapist who worked so teenagers who stutter",
    " so um i think it's different in my life i don't think that much",
    " but um in when i'm in school like it's fun because everyone should understand right and i'm also like the uh i'm also the co chapter leader of the sennos a uh national stuttering association support group so um yeah i'm definitely more open there",
    " with desensitization and um just changing you know again my relationship with stuttering and learning um you know all the tools",
    " and it's a part of some of the things we're hearing today with the acceptance instead of trying to fight it once you've accepted it in my perception you begin to speak with more confidence it's easier and i tend to speak more fluently",
    " and it has motivated me to continue pursuing public speaking and to not shy away from that because it is important to be able to do that once i become a physical therapist probably wouldn't have the great friends that i do now uh i think that it has helped me to meet a lot of people i would have ordinarily met and i think i would really followed a different path in my life because where i grew up i was around a lot of on educate individuals those social economic status and i think it is not just about the academic component of that but it is about to be able to do that with me a lot of people who stutter and have trouble getting your words out",
    " you need go to people listen and listen to what people are saying now they're thinking your saying",
    " she wasn't a specialist uh then stuttering even though she really cared and i think that she did a lot of kind of um um her own research to try to like figure it out so i you know like i felt like i was in like a really safe place with her um and you know there were times where we would be within the sessions and you know things would start to sound like it's not always good and it's not always good but it's like a very effective uh thing to me and i think it's like the best way to learn about stuttering and to learn that there's always a lot of things to be done with this and i think it's like the best way to learn that there's always a lot of fun and fun",
    " but anyhow um this therapist took her extra time to learn about stuttering and she um and she would try her hardest to help and get feedback from her parents",
    "'cause i don't know where i would be i don't know who i would be the person but i did not stutter",
    " uh no one knows the exact cause of stuttering you know stuttering you know you know stuttering um there seems to be a strong genetic link to stuttering um i have to voice",
    " mhm um oh oh um oh um my spouse is also here you know you know you know hear um i tried at one point",
    " and then a gradually speed you up to one second to syllable half a second to syllable and then something called slow normal",
    " so i was just kind of like it's and i'm just there just be a little on the and a little bit i seen on the on the on biting cake for the for metaphor so i yeah so um i think that's positive",
    " um well i uh i went to school for anthropology and i've also done music",
    " you know it's really interesting sometimes i feel like i stutter more uh with my family um and sometimes with my friends as well particularly friends that i haven't seen for a while but that i you know have a very close relationship with it it's like i always feel like i'm kind of like uh reintroducing um my stuttering to them even though it's clear that uh they've always known me as",
    " then i can so um put your money where your mouth is um believe in us",
    " and um i think i get most of my techniques from what they've taught me at hollins which is uh stretch syllables and easy onsets and um i think i use those uh not like unknowingly and um i'm now looking at other uh programs",
    " and i guess just not feeling any guilt at the end of it so but by that what i mean is you know not having oh i guess like gilts is in the word",
    " um and because there really isn't anything in those courses that necessarily says that my voice has to be fluent um and so every time i would give those um i would both have excellent um feedback about",
    " my stutter and it does not impact my daily life i uh i uh uh life all that much right now uh uh uh uh and uh uh uh uh and it doesn't affect me and it doesn't affect me a lot of people",
    " but yeah um uh i've always loved sequence so that kind of thing comes to mind",
    " um and then uh since at the time my stuttering originated uh with reading and so and then it obviously uh showed when i would speak to people too so uh but it was i could tell if i was mild or if i just was able to do things to kinda hide it",
    " uh prospects um stuttering doesn't define me as a person like i try not to let it",
    " so question five if you didn't stutter what might be different in your life um i guess i might have been more confident in different things in my life uh",
    " uh it was hard for me to detect because he also didn't grow up in the US you've even been the Philippines so english is the second language",
    " and since then i've been trying to be more open with my stuttering talking about it for the first and sometimes i'm good at it sometimes the covert um tricks of the trade kick in",
    " um and are much more open to what i have to say it also is an amazing thing in court because it judges zero in on exactly what i'm saying and it has actually made my uh my comments towards clients hold more ground which is really fun",
    " everyone is capable or anything that they can think of right i mean just need a plan and then action so i mean uh yeah that's it i'd say",
    " but there was the general interaction and so it was kind of that was kind of fun to do or like you do it in full grade you're um at it um our our let's say hour",
    " seemingly unrelated to stuttering whether it's uh depression or psychological issues or other issues uh fears and other emotional things and so i feel that i often my stuttering acts is like uh a way of connecting with people more and in that way um i do think about when i'm speaking trying to stutter as openly as possible",
    " it's helped me feel like more authentic i guess successful communication to me means just saying whatever i wanna say um for most of my life i would not say anything",
    " and she told me these techniques you know like um easy onset and prolongation and stuff but i don't really use it much but i feel like i do have a store rate of speech",
    " and it was that period of a moment that has cared me through my life in my career i said i said if i can do this the thing i dreaded the most",
    " so i think um so sometimes it's so it's okay to go off script you know and let them like get whatever they have to get off their chest",
    " but therapy can be done on your own even outside of the therapy room um you know community is a big part of it um and i think that even extends out to everyone else",
    " in the communication even though they or the or in the discussion even though they clearly didn't wanna be having it and i thought that was really positive and at that point it didn't really matter that i stuttered or not because i was um again saying what i wanted to say communicating it in the way i wanted to say it",
    " um maybe i wouldn't be um you know like a good uh uh has good of a listener that i feel that i am today so like small like changes like that i think would be different",
    " um who passed away when i was two so can't confer with it but she says he did and also apparently his father did so my great father and father so and that's just on my mom's side of the family and one of my cousins on my dad's side has a son who stutters his teacher so um i feel like there's other strong genetic component",
    " went to stores and had me really go through that fear hierarchy of difficult speaking situations and i think that the desensitization piece plus me feeling like i can really trust her she was actually the first one who i would tell me that it was a paid stutter and that i think was like the biggest thing is my whole life i thought it wasn't a page just because it was something not everyone does",
    " so um but it's just kind of never getting the support for my parents and confidence to do things where i can potentially make and ask myself not realize if i didn't make and ask myself uh be protected from it on bully or anything like",
    " um so it's not something that i hide and it's not something that i tried to hide but i guess i always i always do wish that i could be uh more fluent uh uh uh than what i am um my interactions with family and friends",
    " for an in service day and i think the most positive was within a minute of the beginning of my presentation i right away said i'm a person or i'm sorry i'm a covert person who stuttered and i said it out loud to twenty five colleagues in the workshop and the workshop that i did not have the right to have the right to have the right to have the right to have the right to have the right to have the right to have the right to have the right to have the right to have the right to have the right to have the right to have the right to have the right to have the right presentation and i think that was the first and the second part of the question that i had thought about was the presentation and i think that was the first and the second part of the question",
    " and that was a long time ago and back back back then they thought i had i had a learning disability rather than stuttering i was my turn to read in the circle",
    " i was close to my mother and i have two siblings and brother and sister and i don't come close to them and all uh school and uh again it uh completely affected me uh the courses i took or courses i wouldn't have to speak in",
    " um and then i think from there there's a huge impact related to learning into um just like living as a person who stutters that tends to lead to the condition getting potentially worse in but certainly more complex and that's how i think people begin to learn ways to actually make their stuttering more difficult and not as they're trying to help themselves",
    " um at the nsa conference last week um there were guys in the military who stuttered uh they said that i probably just had a bad doctor that the doctor probably had a bad day that day and just didn't want to i don't know more maybe he was just a jerk so uh yeah so um yeah it's",
    " that's kind of a tough question because every stutterer is different and they react to specific questions differently and i've been part of the interview project with the dallas chapter now for a few years where i have future slps talk to me um or interview me and it's always easy to make and it's always been a tough one",
    " for that to really sort of sink in um um yeah so that's the reader's digest version of it i could talk on that for two hours and a half",
    " but it provides me with so much entertainment and so many interesting things that i think i would i don't think i would be nearly as happy i don't think i would be nearly as full i don't think i would be as culturally confident",
    " or probably a mutation or a serious mutations some or down the line",
    " but help them with their goals and whatever that may be um don't force your judge on them",
    " i didn't know why i didn't say i stuttered it was just a speech class",
    " so that gave me some confidence but i gave the speech to i guess a several hundred people but at the end of the speech and until this day i looked back at it",
    " i mean nobody has ever told me what i can and can't say and nobody will ever ever prevent me from saying it",
    " to gain my confident like confidence back so yeah i would say would just be that the two people can understand each other that is the main point",
    " the great majority of people will not be able to so uh uh uh uh uh so that's the single biggest stutter uh uh as uh uh stuttered criticism that i have because it just does not transfer to the stutter and it doesn't give us the confidence to be able to do so",
    " he said i had he said i had a think tongue and a think friendling and he wanted me to practice some quirky technique i did behind that",
    " do not interrupt them uh uh uh uh uh do not uh uh talk over them uh uh uh do not fill in their words",
    " well if i stutter what if this one if that with that um now now they say not so much",
    " so i became an engineer i've uh uh uh uh to get back to it i do i believe i could have been more successful had i had support earlier and there were more effective speech therapies than quite possible",
    " so i can wait to see like really what causes that so uh i would say",
    " i went to the covert workshop as a speech pathologist i never knew what i was doing had a name so i went and i heard all the stories",
    " the fluency stuff um i don't think it did much i don't remember many ever being able to use any of it in real life for it really changing anything but the additional stuff really pushed me to start seeing my life as a stutterer instead of really seeing it as only being able to be lived unless i was fluent",
    " like graduated like like film and tv and like um some editing work and it was really happy",
    " um historically my stuttering has uh propended me or held me back in um school activities uh public activities um i've always been pretty open with my family",
    " so if i get i try to get over ninety percent over everything else but this one thing maybe it won't be so bad but then um but then also maybe without stuttering it would have also changed the pressure that um was put on uh by both myself and my parents because then they're like hey why are you lacking in this",
    " um and you know and yeah i think for my success and you know uh professionally and socially i don't know i think i probably have a much easier time you know than i do know but it's not to um say that everything would be perfect if i didn't stutter and you know there will be challenges and things like that um um but um um and i guess there's also to that i mean i the one thing i've been but that helps me is just try to think about",
    " i still used to the stutter and i think i had one other short term therapy after about two years after out of college um",
    " so i mean it could be genetics yeah i don't yeah i don't think there's an exact cause if i've ever had therapy that the question",
    " uh i am doing a master in by your by your biology so of course i looked it up uh so i know it's like gene",
    " um i would say that it as impacted my life um i when i was like younger in school i would hate to do like the overall overall presentation",
    " no um i actually was at the mall last week serving people",
    " like so i am if you don't like it oh go about don't care",
    " um i guess what i do know is what didn't happen and this is a more order of me going back to the uh question two",
    " just because i've been doing it so long um one quick example when i was waiting for my airplane on um Wednesday i started talking with this couple and they were talked about where we're going",
    " that that was wonderful yeah um just being able to say what you wanna say regardless if you stutter or not",
    " you know you know you know you don't take speech for granted so you know you realize the value of being able to express yourself and you know you know you know try to say things that have more meetings",
    " know uh i personally it i have had a lot of emotional problems and concepts that existed for a long long time because i didn't really have speech therapy you know so just please keep in mind that you have to treat the speech problems that the person has",
    " wasn't about uh using techniques which i did learn and relearn but more about acceptance of the fact that i stutter",
    " i hated being different i did the therapy i did all the exercises the night before and she kinda knew it and i really hated how i sound sounded and then in high school i wanted something different and i wanted to change myself",
    " but stuttering sort of breaks up all those patterns and forces people to really uh communicate with each other outside of those routines and i think that makes communication more successful because it's not done by heuristics um a recent communicative exchange or successful was",
    " um yes i did when i was younger",
    " um in my daily life it doesn't really have an impact on me um because i don't allow it to have an impact on me um uh i think it was in my job uh where i talk to the customers um and they don't they don't know that i start and i have to be you know a bit professional and",
    " the graduate school i went to Purdue offered therapy for free to the students and i went there and that was actually a good experience uh the first guy i saw was probably good but i don't think i was ready for it",
    " okay i'm gonna end it here and start a different file for each of the six questions or what do you think causes stuttering i type always as whom there was a genetic component to it",
    " um it just happens to take us a bit longer to talk um yeah",
    " you know know the terminology um no one people struggle with um three like never forget that yes like there are people who stutter but they're more than just their stutter to you",
    " the stuttering will less than one is that something i've learned myself i didn't learn that until i was really when i reached middle of year",
    " and why how does that work uh i know that we do not all of them yet",
    " so i've had tremendous outcomes through avoidance reduction therapy sure so successful communication to me means that other people understand you and you're able to convey your messages in a way that's enjoyable for both parties",
    " i mean for me that i don't really even have to speculate because for you know the first eighteen years of my life i didn't stutter and uh and uh and so so you know that i just compare myself to uh to the way i was then and then the way i was now and you know i was so much more confident and i had a lot more uh social life than uh you know i especially when i got to college or stuttering i mean i was a lot of that and now it's kind of mad i'm trying to get that all right"
