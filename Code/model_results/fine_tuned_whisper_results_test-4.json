    "i just interviewed somebody for stutter talk podcast um she was a young woman from china and uh we had a great conversation about her she was a young woman who stutters from china and we had a great conversation about her upbringing in china",
    "i kind of thought um i never was in the military or kind of wanted to be one ever since a kid um",
    "even though i'm the only person in my family who stutters i can go back to my parents of course and to one set of grandparents and there wasn't any stuttering there i really don't know much about my father's parents",
    "so um had about that stuff but um actual therapy and outcomes i'm not really don't know",
    "yeah a lot i think the most important is to meet other people who stutter and uh no matter if you're a student or whatever um",
    "and in that list of reasons we don't have children one of those is that i wouldn't want to have a child i would say um to look",
    "i don't know was the uh popular thing in then nineties um but you know uh obviously that turned out to not be the treatment for me",
    "that answered the question i think it is a um it's a genetic there's a genetic cause to it it's a physiological cause",
    "also environmental factors um we also know that there are differences in like the brains of people who stutter and the and people who don't stutter so there's clearly some um you know neurological differences as well so i actually only had speech therapy one time and it was a senior i was a senior at high school it was pretty random i was at a really rough time in my life",
    "i would cheat i would write down those instances on a piece of paper just turn it in but yes they taught me some of the basic techniques of easy onsets",
    "when i was a sophomore in high school so i was uh fourteen years old first time i'd ever heard of a speech therapist",
    "um so that's what they thought and i never really talked about it with my family it just didn't happen",
    "is that there is so much emotional you know you know issues um you know um every speech person that has gone through any class should have probably heard about the iceberg stuttering um you know uh you know you know",
    "well currently i am in speech therapy under the tutelage of a brilliant speech therapist and she knows who she is um and working with her and her staff i have been unlearning everything all my former slps have taught me and what i am focused on now is just stuttering openly without any guilt or shame and loving it",
    "there are some situations that i probably have not done because i didn't feel like stuttering through um you asked what else",
    "he is the most competitive person i've ever met in my life and he fights everyday past his stutter and i give the guy credit galore",
    "um like try not to do that probably still do it um but i guess i know um in talking to family members",
    "it was it helped more although it didn't make much of a difference and then a few years after that",
    "stuttering has an impact mostly in work and in school for me not so much in the social setting with my friends i'm not really too concerned about whether i stutter and how i sound but it definitely does impact me in class with raising my hand",
    "so it's uh uh there's some mind games there i think that happen um i think sometimes i still get um more hesitant to kind of put myself out there in certain social situations with people uh who i don't know but i'm you know i'm a fairly like an outgoing person so i try not to let it get into my way but i can see that there you know are certain times where it's still uh probably does",
    "but what i you do is i try to clearly enunciate every single word that i say i talk in a louder voice and i think that has some sort of a choral effect type of a deal where i kind of hear myself talking and i maintain a confident presence",
    "i would say uh for me now successful communication means getting my point across to the other person i'm communicating with um but say uh at work i'm in like a meeting um and i need to get some technical detail over to other members of my team to just convey some requirement of a design",
    "i think successful communication is when you are able to express what you wanna say when you want say it in a way that the listener receives that message and you can both in a back and forth fashion so the person you're speaking to can also express what they wanna say when they want to say it",
    "than just the words you choose so i mean it's i think it's truly being in control and saying not only what you wanna say but in the manner you wanna say too and you know that's i think one of the uh uh why i feel stutter's been a hindrance to successful communication",
    "and so probably by that time um like twenty eight twenty nine and onward uh stuttering it still would come out but it didn't have as much of an impact on me as possible um and uh fast forward from four years into since i've met my first person who stuttered and i've met a whole bunch of other people and so um i think now stuttering is impactful in the other direction of just it i do come across people who stutter more often",
    "um so i'd say the uh the cause is definitely uh genetic with neural biological um um or like outcomes because of that genetic abnormality",
    "i wouldn't change it at all like i literally can't even imagine my life now if i hadn't found out about the nsa",
    "and we can reinforce stuttered ways of speaking through our um i don't wanna say bad habits 'cause i don't think it's a good or bad thing it just it's just something that happens automatically but i think if the stuttering doesn't resolve in early childhood and you start to develop reactions to it",
    "but uh that's not the answer i would have given up until the age of forty or so i would have said i have a physical impairment that stops me and i'm not a long distance runner because i physically i can't do something like that and for the same reason there are things that i can't achieve because i have a physical impairment but now i don't think that i think i was holding myself back",
    "and how differently stuttering was viewed uh dramatically differently from the united states and uh we laughed a lot and i learned a lot and it was a lot of fun",
    "uh it's more than just verbal um a positive relation a positive",
    "because i was in the student government i was in the air force rotc but the speech therapy kept me i guess focused on practicing",
    "currently or in the past 'cause that could be a long one stuttering has had a variety of impacts on me",
    "and uh but um yeah i think it's brain related uh and that transference from thought to speech and then that articulation or something yeah",
    "but i would say that my stuttering is still the same it's just around different um uh circumstances and my stuttering has been from what i would call probably mild",
    "there were times a lot of times in class where i would not you know raise my hand in class because didn't wanna",
    "um asking them questions about stuttering and i was talking to one guy who kept finishing my sentences for me but even though he did that i like finished my sentence while he was finishing mine",
    "um i think it it's uh genetics uh something whether it's a",
    "um but unfortunately i think there's not enough understanding of about stuttering and for that reason it is imperative that a person who stutters finds a speech therapist who really understands stuttering uh as opposed to someone who attempts to understand but really doesn't and can end up screwing up clients even more communication is any way that thoughts or actions are being perceived",
    "participation in community activities that simply didn't happen that would been voluntary and uh that simply didn't happen",
    "and i passed one interview and i got it so",
    "so a lot of um the when people stutter the brain you know is activated in a certain way that suggests an interference and that leads to um the speech disfluency that we see and the stuttering like behaviors that we see",
    "because i get a chance to practice my speech therapy every day with each person and when they get to the point of asking me what i do",
    "um i would say you know the biggest thing overall is just to have patience um um you know and um and to understand that stutterers aren't that much different than the average person i mean everyone has their struggles",
    "i'm trying to think um i've done toastmasters um that was once again like i just try and throw myself out into a um environment where i have to do public speaking",
    "and i think we need to um hold that the other thing is there this is a very tricky line i still haven't quite reconciled it",
    "but it's certainly not me i think other things in our lives uh has the build ability to uh you know add some pressure to it to things but i don't think that that's like the cause",
    "so i think that happened so it took me a while to get out of my shell and learn about who i am and how i can speak without being ashamed of it",
    "um uh i'm not sure like if i mean like i guess you know there's ongoing research now uh investigating like you know what particular genes are being are mutated and um you know how that links to stuttering",
    "so some days i speak fairly fluently without much effort and other days i struggle more naturally and it's just the way that it is it's not that i'm more anxious one day or another day",
    "and that's how it was for many many years up until i was eighteen so six seven years",
    "mhm hmm yeah yes",
    "um sure the impact is pretty huge um if you ask some my friends or family or just people i hang out with they may not think so because you know i'm participating i'm talking i'm social i'm making jokes um so it all seems pretty okay but it's still only a fraction of what i would give or present if i didn't stutter",
    "so i mean like i said you know it's i would say it's overall good um as far as you know community activities i'm really the two biggest things i'm involved with is church and i'm an adult leader with the boy",
    "um and then i guess uh i i kinda just went on throughout school without therapy until you know again the tail end of high school i finally you know had the opportunity to go to um a uh uh uh facility that focused uh primarily on stuttering",
    "i would have always wanted to do was to be a dj it sounds funny",
    "and then depending on how you develop um i would imagine in the womb and also through childhood those genes can be expressed to more or less an extent and then um the way your neurophysiology and autonomy anatomy develop um seems to either reinforce stuttering or to help it uh dissolve resolve on its own",
    "but you know maybe not so that's right oh well yeah i just think that um it's important um not to um underestimate um anyone um",
    "and in order to be successful you have to be patient and i think with this even though i stutter it's can come out kind of sloppy compared to other people um",
    "sure um well so in my uh daily life i'm uh in the army so i'm uh frequently um speaking to uh crowds uh of soldiers or uh other officers uh and so uh sometimes i have to start by being very directive to uh gain control uh of the uh situation",
    "oh yeah so to support people who stutter be a really good listener be patient don't fill in their sentences or their words 'cause oftentimes you'll guess wrong and then it'll take even longer to communicate the message so uh be patient and that's the best thing that you can do for someone who",
    "because again i was going to college in the sixties and uh it was at that time when we all wanted to save the world and i wanted to go into social work",
    "but i've had a wonderful life and i had a great job so i have no complaints",
    "sixth grade you're top of the elementary school food chain and what she had me do was help make uh paper clowns",
    "um and there was my teacher who would keep me uh standing up in class until i could pronounce the words correctly or say something correctly and i know before that in first grade i was going to speech therapy and i don't know what it was um as for my records i haven't been able to get 'em",
    "even before i started kindergarten so i went i've been in and out of school therapy up until middle school and then i gave up on the school therapy around ninth grade when i started high school um then i also went to the hollins uh fluency program which uh is a fluency shaping uh program in high school",
    "but i think being able to do that spontaneously it's really difficult and i feel like probably uh the reason for that is that there's other uh uh psychological things that are happening uh with your speech and you know i think that goes back to what i said for the first answer which was you know oh why do i seem to stutter more with people you know who i love and who love me you know",
    "but i really haven't been keeping track and so i really don't know so in my mind i stutter a fair amount but it's really not impact my life that much",
    "um is i'm a very mild stutterer so i don't really it doesn't really impact me too much um especially when thinking about family and friends um",
    "sure well um well you know well um my father was a stutterer until he was fourteen and then he you know uh you know stopped um my parents pretty much thought i would just spontaneously quit stuttering so",
    "the most one of the most pivotal moments of my life as a person that stutters was graduation from high school i was president of the national honors society and my advisor made me give the graduation speech",
    "but they really never knew it was sometimes i would just have to pause and go",
    "but if i do stutter a lot then so be it as long as my message is clear",
    "i found i was a little bit embarrassed hearing him stutter because i thought he was mimicking me when i got to graduate school uh things were essentially breathing techniques and other things like that and it helped a great deal and they tried to tell me just keep talking take the opportunity to talk in class",
    "uh but i think that i am actually somehow some way it's like a mysterious thing to me actually um um but like what does it mean",
    "therefore you stutter i stutter therefore i'm nervous",
    "i um you know kind of went back to school for respiratory therapy and now i'm working as an ekg tech so my job is to stare at squiggly lines all day",
    "both at an early age and then again uh during college um aside from that most of the speech therapists i had did not help at all in fact a lot made it worse",
    "i don't sing very well so that i won't say that one i can't carry a tune in a bucket",
    "and he you know sometimes um that's been a detriment but i think on the whole um you know it's probably made me a better person hmm i don't know um you know i would say uh uh learn about the",
    "let them create the own agenda their own agenda and don't follow the textbook just because chapter six of book whatever says you have to do this",
    "so it's nice to have your back uh it's nice to have family that has your back um that's kind of a hard question to answer but i think it's i don't know if this is i don't know if this answers the question but what makes my stutter worse is unknown situations",
    "but it took many years and it took a lot of um getting to know people and being around the stuttering community",
    "um i did also attend this darp uh fluency clinic um at age thirteen and then at age fourteen and then came back as a refresher for a few years and mentor for a couple of years and i believe it is no longer in existence um but that program was uh was helpful in a lot of ways to get uh to reduce my fear of speaking in public uh because it forced you to uh which now has led to one of my jobs which is being a public uh speaker",
    "it was at the same time scary frightening but also at the same time it was kind of exhilarating 'cause i don't like public speaking that much",
    "in a relatively clear and efficient manner not necessarily a fluent one uh uh and a positive experience is being able to talk to my coworkers and discuss very nasty technical problems with them uh uh uh uh",
    "so um yeah oh well um i could think of whole lot um i definitely think i wouldn't have been the confident person that i am today",
    "or make fun of them back but in high school you know that's when like the full weight of stuttering really hit me um uh but then you know beyond that in uh um the tail end of high school",
    "um effective communication i would say is when a person speaking or acting is able to convey his or her thoughts effectively to the person receiving those comments thoughts or what have you um literally being a social worker and therapist uh communication becomes of the utmost importance of making sure that each client feels heard and understood um i think in life communication becomes the way of the world because if you're not understood you feel highly left out",
    "and then doing things like this uh for nsa and one of the things that i'm doing",
    "unless they ask um let them speak no matter how long it takes um don't laugh don't judge um and i think the biggest thing is just encourage people who stutter just to be themselves go up and speak in public",
    "get the curveball get the you know that um",
    "um who had an who helped me tremendously yes charles darpweather who really had a tremendous impact on me",
    "i always questioned like am i the only one that stuttered how will this impact future jobs could someone see past the fact that i stutter",
    "or at least up there um she didn't know quite everything about stuttering but she took the time outside of our oh and by the way so far all these therapists have been are employed by the public school system",
    "and the emotional aspect is fourth through fifth or sixth i was in elementary school and i think that was a lot better controlled from the teachers 'cause i had teacher a teacher",
    "i think ashamed's probably a good word and also feel like that um i guess the analogy is uh um i for like can i just tell story um with my or we or with my mba program",
    "um another family member mentioned the same thing and so i did go back um i went back my junior year of college",
    "uh it's a completely physical phenomenon i'm not sure what that what the physical component is i tend to think someday there will be a pill that cures it",
    "if you didn't stutter what might be different in your life i can give um uh one word answer to that that would be everything absolutely everything would be different in my life",
    "and i guess i would have more friends for people who stutter or for students oh",
    "uh that of course didn't happen so but they we still stopped it i didn't have to go past it again um after that it was graduate school that i next saw a therapist",
    "because we need to look at the whole system and not just one piece and i think that is happening",
    "so it was kind of like there was never really um a demonstrative but it's also a very um a childhood that was very uh isolated 'cause no one was asking me how i was feeling",
    "i was told to slow down uh that was uh she had a good heart the speech therapist uh i what i got out of it was a person to talk to uh as far as the speech therapy uh i don't think it was uh productive in it made it better it was productive in that i had an adult to talk to",
    "but um yeah um but in daily life with my family it isn't um an issue and uh i don't think uh about it when i go into stores or um order uh food which is good thing um",
    "and i gave it that night i was nervous um i will say i was in all white so i looked good right",
    "because me as a child having someone else who is who has the same sort of challenges that i have i would've listened to them i would not have cheated on my assignments had the speech language pathologist been someone no not at all",
    "and i trust myself now and i know that it doesn't define me it's part of who i am",
    "um i think lots of i guess the cause the actual physical mechanism that creates a disfluency it seems that most of the research is suggesting it's has uh genetic origins or there you have a genetic predisposition to stutter",
    "in your voice oh gee i just won the maryland powerball",
    "i would've got better grades i'll tell you that um because uh uh i was basically a straight a student until second grade and then uh my participation grade started to drop um just because i was more shy in the classroom",
    "um so yeah i first got therapy when i was nineteen so it was summer after my freshmen year of college and um it was just a standard you know uh you weekly sessions and you know at that point i was so new to the whole thing and i'd never seen a speech therapist before and i didn't quite know what to expect and uh she wasn't a bad uh uh therapist but i don't think i was fully knew what i was getting myself into or knew how to get the most out of it",
    "and you know sometimes that client could be having a uh bad day and you know they don't wanna work on you know techniques or you know whatever you might have planned for them",
    "and every time i start stuttering i'm reminded of how my parents do not and will not understand my stuttering in the way that i want them to it's my parents' feelings that the shorter my sentences are the less likely i will be to stutter and that to me is just completely way off the beam",
    "my my mom is a person who stutters and so is my brother and i think that she didn't wanna call too much attention to it which in retrospect wasn't the healthiest thing but i think she thought it would be best for me to kinda go under the radar",
    "i was also applying for colleges i knew i had i had college interviews to do and i was just becoming more and more self conscious and also becoming more covert about my stuttering so i decided i needed help and that's when i got therapy which really changed the way i look at my stuttering now go for it",
    "but i have a really good support system and i'm also not like uh you know a shy type of guy so you know i wouldn't say the effect on me is super high",
    "and i uh my speech therapist told me about like the avoidance behaviors and like secondary behaviors and so i'd like took notice of that and i tried not to do that anymore but i think what's hard for me is like eye contact is difficult",
    "um it's a there's depending on the depth of it perhaps there's even a level of uh trust established um there's a relationship building",
    "i go to dr drayna's uh lectures all time and also dr mcguire's so it's a multifactorial multimodal cause",
    "you know just speaking for myself that you know that wasn't uh um the uh tools for those weren't the tools for me um and so i kinda like uh settled with stuttering openly",
    "i've only had one therapeutic experience and that was when i was in elementary school um but the lessons i've learned was to like breathe through the words",
    "you know and so i she i really bonded with her psychologically because she made me realize that she really cared about me and with all of my education and all of the stuff she wasn't going to let me get by with anything",
    "and i don't remember a lot of it but i think it helped me a lot but what helped me more in undergraduate and even until now",
    "i might not be married to my wife or have my children or my house so uh i like where i'm at",
    "and then you know i was able to get over that and then i went to the peace corps and in about my second year of that i got so frustrated again with my speech that i went uh to the hollins uh fluency center or something",
    "great um well first um i uh don't stutter nearly as much as i used to i um you know had some good therapy and all of that but as far as how it impacts me now i would say it impacts me in regard to the idea that it's pretty much what i do",
    "conference with us but there are things you can do and a couple of things come to mind",
    "i know that you can have a fluent person that has trauma and then they now are a stutterer always and that's you know i don't know",
    "in order to create that sort of intimacy in the conversation um but i think about it much less than i used to when i was still struggling with it uh yeah",
    "most everything i suppose 'cause like i was saying earlier at my whole career is around stuttering and i a lot of my friends i met through stuttering my girlfriend i met in memphis because i was going to school for stuttering in memphis",
    "so i'm sure for some people it's very different too and you know they know um",
    "through elementary school and first year of junior high and i remember we played um simon's says and that's about",
    "yeah you know i mean you know i've i thought i was stupid i didn't have you know self worth",
    "i'd rather stutter and show the feeling and show the emotion so it's what i've accepted i think the jury is still out on that",
    "depression at times um i think anxiety is is a has a major impact um i think hormones can have a major impact",
    "so you know that i can help other people with the experiences i've had related to stuttering um what i've seen that um it's it seems like it's a combination of um uh like uh genetics and neurological conditions",
    "but once i was told it was okay that was like a huge load off my back and everything else got easier yeah so i think that i know now there's a lot of research about genetics and stuttering",
    "i don't know but i switched from that to respiratory care so yeah",
    "and for her she's having to learn so how is it impacting my life my goodness how has it not impacted my life everything about my life has every thing that i've done in my life has been impacted by how i talk",
    "the fluency shaping gains are almost impossible to both transfer and maintain uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh because what they ask of you is to learn this artificial uh uh speaking style that does not match your usual style",
    "um and that was the last time i received therapy i left there still stuttering quite severely but with a changed attitude and but i would say the biggest changes in my speech happened in grad school um where it was a lot of self therapy i guess",
    "or just people making snide comment so sorry about that um that's about three a um",
    "i think his jokes are horrible but um he's a very good character that a good example where the boys don't make fun of him for stuttering",
    "although though it's been fifteen years ago to callier center here in dallas",
    "which you know had a lot of hope but uh not a lot of uh actual relief uh you know i mean i did everything from you know hypnotherapy",
    "some suicide attempts bullying on and on",
    "i work in a shop so i have to um be professional and not stutter that much um but in my daily life with friends and family so it doesn't really have an impact on me i think um because everyone knows that i stutter and it's just part of me and it's the way i talk i guess yeah",
    "um uh uh if hobbies are a part of community activities uh um from eighteen to thirty two i was uh competing in uh amateur automobile racing uh the um with the sports car club of america scca um uh my in my late twenties i became four time regional champion of autocross and rallycross in my region",
    "so i got the most out of that because she made me practice successful communication means that delivering your message",
    "um i think communication is successful when the two or multiple parties can comprehend each other and so like if there's understanding with what's said no matter how it's said i think that's good communication",
    "um i think that for me i feel like i'm a successful communicator when i'm saying what i wanna say when i wanna say it and when i'm open with people about my stuttering and i'm not trying to avoid stuttering and i think an example of when i was successful is recently i was interviewing for jobs um",
    "um but overall i think that stuttering has helped me because it did lead me to my job and my career and hopefully a long career ahead of me i guess one thought that i would say is that stuttering's more complex than you could see um and also stuttering varies tremendously from day to day",
    "or if i have a different tone so i don't know that one so i'm not sure what prevents stuttering from occurring causes if there's a cause",
    "finds a way to you know be comfortable with themself that's you know i hear talk of the cure and this and that",
    "and that i think what speech therapists especially you need to bear in mind when they're working with people who stutter is that the stutter itself is not the problem it's the effort spent in wrestling with the stutter and that i think it's possible to stutter without effort",
    "um yeah successful communication i guess that would mean getting your message across um as best as possible",
    "i forgot something um going back to question three um different um i forgot to mention my parents",
    "so as a therapist as a social worker as a supervisor as presenter as a speaker however you wanna look at it people tend to open up to me a quite a lot faster",
    "and one experience that she had uh that was almost a negative was that she walked into a donut shop trying to order something and the girl behind the counter was doing this and instantly she wanted to walk out of the store but she held her composure and ordered what she wanted and instantly she broke down in tears when she left the store",
    "assuming i started stuttering in elementary school but all throughout like my school days i went to speech therapy um and school and i was working on fluency shaping techniques",
    "i enjoy people's responses i really actually am entertained by the facial expressions i get when i'm putting on a little bit more and people provide faces that you could almost see out saturday night live skit it's pretty funny",
    "and by the time of then i've had speech therapy so that should i was un normal you couldn't tell i stuttered i didn't identify as someone that stuttered",
    "and you know other uh self help groups it has led me to pursuing um uh a uh career in speech pathology um so uh it so there are some positive aspects of stuttering",
    "and kind of just did it just to get out there and just kind of just do stuff um and really wouldn't i don't think it affected me that much people could probably tell i was a stutterer",
    "so a really positive experience that i recently was where i gave a keynote speech um at a nonprofit organization it was a fundraiser gala and i'm a graduate of the program and there i was speaking to over two hundred and fifty wealthy individuals who were looking to uh support our cause and i gave about an eight minute speech in front of these people and it was extremely nerve wracking but i enjoyed it tremendously and i received really great feedback from it afterwards",
    "i think that the most is that the people who stutter um like the kind of therapy that they are getting so maybe like ask",
    "uh and i think having a speech impediment uh it helped me empathize with uh the clientele that we were assisting with um uh um there were few who had similar speech impediments as some just connected with me 'cause uh i was maybe thought as other as he was um uh um and then covid hit and i started to work the positive covid units on top of ngri"

    "also environmental factors um we also know that there are differences in like the brains of people who stutter and the and people who don't stutter so there's clearly some um you know neurological differences as well so i actually only had speech therapy one time and i was a senior i was a senior in high school it was pretty random i was a really rough time in my life",
    "i would cheat i would write down those instances on the piece of paper and just turn it in but yes they taught me some of the basic techniques of easy onsets",
    "when i was a sophomore in high school so i was uh 14 years old first time i'd ever heard of the speech therapists",
    "um so that's what they thought and i never really talked about it with my family it just didn't happen",
    "is that there is so much emotional issues you know you know issues um every you know um every speech person that has gone through any class should have probably heard about the uh uh the uh uh iSberg stuttering um you know uh a lot of things that uh uh that physically something happens and fluent speech uh can be created",
    "well currently i am in speech therapy uh under the tutelage of a brilliant speech therapist and therapist and therapist",
    "there are some situations that i probably have not done because i didn't feel like stuttering um us what else",
    "he is the most competitive person i've ever met my life and he fights every day and has to stutter then i give the guy credit going",
    "um i try not to do that probably still do it um but i guess i know um in talking to family members",
    "it was it helped more although i didn't make much of a difference and then a few years after that",
    "stuttering has an impact mostly in working in school for me not so much in the social setting with my friends i'm not really too concerned about whether i stutter and how i sound but it definitely does impact me in class with the reason my hand",
    "so it's uh uh there's some mind games there i think that happen um i think sometimes i still get uh more hesitant to kind of put myself out there in certain social situations with people uh who i don't know but i'm you know i'm a fairly like an outgoing person so i try not to let it get into my way but i can see that there you know are certain times where it's don't probably be a bit technical but it can be a bit technical",
    "but what i you do is i try to clearly enunciate every single word that i say i talking a louder voice and i think that has some sort of a neural effect type of a deal where i kind of hear myself talking and i maintain a confident presence",
    "i would say uh for me now successful communication means getting my point across to the other person i'm communicating with um let's say uh uh work i'm in like a meeting um and i need to get some technical detail over to a other me that i'm in like a meeting um and i need to get some technical detail over to a other person in like a meeting um",
    "i think successful communication is when you are able to express what you wanna say when you wanna say it in a way that the listener receives that message and you can both in a back and forth fashion so the person you're speaking to can also express what they wanna say when they wanna say it",
    "and just the words you choose so i mean it's i think it's truly being controlled and saying not only what you wanna say but in the manner you wanna say it too when you know that's i think where the uh uh why i feel stutter's been a hindrance to the successful communication",
    "and so probably by that time um like twenty eight twenty nine onward uh stuttering it still would come out but it didn't have as much of an impact on me as possible um and uh fast for um four years into since i've met my first person who stuttered my met a whole bunch of other people and so um i think now stuttering is impacted on the other direction of just in a way that uh it doesn't affect me as much i guess",
    "um so i say the uh cause is definitely uh genetic with neurological um um recent or like outcomes because of that genetic environment",
    "i wouldn't change it at all like i literally can't even imagine my life now if i and found out about the nsa",
    "and we can reinforce stuttered ways of speaking through our um i don't want to say bad habits because i don't think it's a good or bad thing it just something that happens automatically but i think if the stuttering doesn't resolve an early childhood and you start to develop reactions to it",
    "but uh that's not the answer i would have given up until the age of forty or so i would have said i have a physical environment that stops me and i'm not a long distance runner because i physically i can't do something like that and for the same reason there are things that i can't achieve because i have a physical environment but now i don't think that i think i was holding myself back",
    "and how differently stuttering would view uh dramatically differently from the united states and uh we laughed a lot and i learned a lot and it was a lot of fun",
    "it's uh it's more than just from uh a positive relationship a positive",
    "if i was in the student government i was an airforcer at tc but the speech therapy kept me i guess focused on practicing",
    "current or in the past because that could be a long one stuttering's had a variety of impacts on me",
    "uh but um yeah i think it's brain related and that transfer's from thought to thought to speech and then that articulation or something like that",
    "but i would say that my stuttering is still the same it's just around different um uh circumstances and my stuttering has been from what i would call probably mild",
    "there are times a lot of times in class where i would not raise my hand in class because then when it",
    "um asking them questions about stuttering and i was talking to one guy who kept finishing my sentences for me but even though he did that i like finished my sentence while he was finishing mine",
    "um i think it's a genetics uh something whether it's",
    "um but unfortunately i think there is not enough understanding of both stuttering and for that reason it is imperative that a person who stutters finds a speech therapist who really understands stuttering uh as opposed to someone who attempts to understand but really doesn't think that and uh screw up clients even more communication is any way that the thoughts or actions or interactions with a person who stutters",
    "participation in community activities that since something didn't happen that would've been voluntary and uh that simply didn't happen",
    "and i pass one interview and i got it so",
    "so a lot of um the when people stutter the brain you know is activated in a certain way that suggests an interference and that leads to um the speech disfluency that we see and the stuttering like behaviors that we see",
    "because i got a chance to practice my speech therapy every day with each person and schooling what they get to point of asking what i do",
    "um i would say you know the biggest thing overall is just to have patience um um you know and um to understand that stutters aren't that much they're not as um likely to be a part of that what was the first part",
    "um trying to think of um i've done to his master's um that was once again like i just trying to run myself out into a um environment where i ate perhaps the public speaking",
    "and i think we need to um hold that the other thing is there this is a very tricky line i still haven't quite read i can tell them",
    "but it's certainly not me i think other things in our lives has the uh has the ability to uh you know add some pressure to the thing but i don't think that's like the cause",
    "so i think that happened so it took me a while to get out of my shell and learn about who i am and how i can speak without the initiative of it",
    "um uh i'm not sure like if i mean like i guess you know there's on going research now uh investigating like you know what particular genes are being are mutated and um you know how that links to stuttering",
    "so some days i speak fairly fluently without much effort and other days i struggle more naturally and it's just the way that it is it's not that i'm more anxious one day or another day",
    "and that's how it was for many years up until i was eighteen so it's six seven years",
    "questions yeah yes",
    "um sure the impact is pretty huge um if us and my friends or family or just people like me hang out with they may not think so because you know i'm participating i'm talking i'm social i'm making jokes um so it all seems pretty okay but it's still only a fraction of what i would give or present if i didn't stutter or whatnot is i wouldn't have had the wouldn't be the same person",
    "so i mean like i said you know it's i would say it's over um as far as you know activities and really two biggest things i'm in a church and i'm an adult i mean a lot of things happen in a church and i'm in a uh environment i mean a lot of things happen in a um environment that i'm in a uh environment that i'm in a uh environment that i'm in a uh environment with my friends",
    "um and then i guess uh i kinda just went on throughout school with therapy until you know again until end of high school i finally you know had the opportunity to go to um a uh uh uh for a facility that focused uh primarily on stuttering",
    "i wouldn't have always wanted to do was to be a dj it sounds funny",
    "and then depending on how you develop um i would imagine in the womb and also through childhood those genes can be expressed to more or less an extent and then um the way your neurophysiology and autonomy anatomy develop um seems to either reinforce stuttering or to help it uh resolve on it and help it be able to do that spectacularly well",
    "but you know maybe not so uh well yeah i just think that um it's important um not to um under estimate um anyone um",
    "and in order to be successful you have to be patient and i think with this even though i stutter it can come out kind of sloppy and compact and compare other people um",
    "sure um well so in my uh daily life i'm uh in the army so i'm uh frequently um speaking to uh crowds of uh uh soldiers or uh other officers uh and um so uh sometimes i have to start by being very directive to uh gain control uh so that i don't run low on air or i'm not really sure what causes stuttering",
    "oh yeah so to support people who stutter be a really good listener be patient don't fill in their sentences or their words oftentimes you'll guess wrong and then it'll take even longer to communicate the message so uh be patient and that's the best thing that you can do for someone who",
    "because again i was going to college in the since seventies and uh it was at that time we all wanted to save the world and i wanted to go into social work",
    "but i've had a wonderful life and i had a great job so i've no complaints",
    " sixth grade your top of the elementary school food chain and what she had me do is help make clown or paperwork clowns",
    "um and there was my teacher who would keep me uh standing up in class until i could pronounce the word's correctly or say something correctly and i know before that in first grade i was going through speech therapy and i don't know what it was um as my records haven't been helped to get them",
    "even before i started kindergarten so i've been in and out of school therapy up until middle school and then i gave up on the school therapy around ninth grade when i started high school um and then i also went to the hollins uh fluency program which uh is uh fluency it's not fluency but it's of but it's fairly common",
    "but i think being able to do that spontaneously is really difficult and i feel like probably uh the reason for that is is that there's other uh uh psychological things that are happening uh with your speech and you know i think that goes back to what i said for the first answer which was you know oh oh oh but it would seem to stutter more with people uh who aren't worried about my speech uh",
    "uh i really haven't keeping track of things i really don't know so in my mind i stutter a fair amount but it's really not that i haven't had the impact of my life that much",
    "um it's i'm a very mouthutterer so i don't really it doesn't really impact me too much um especially when thinking about family and friends um",
    "sure well um well you know well um my father was a stutterer until he was forty and then he stopped you know stopped uh you know stopped um my parents pretty much thought i would just spontaneously quit stuttering so",
    "the most one of the most pivotal moments in my life as a person that stutters was graduation from high school i was president of the national society and my advisor made me give this the graduation speech",
    "or they really never knew us because i just have the pause and go",
    ,"but if i do stutter a lot then so be it as long as my message is clear"
    "i found i was a little bit embarrassed hearing him stutter because he was mimicking me when i got to graduate school uh things were essentially breathing techniques and other things like that and it helped a great deal and they tried to tell me just keep talking take the opportunity to talk in class",
    "but i think that i am actually somehow some way it's like a mysterious thing to me actually um uh but like what does it mean",
    "thereful you stutter i stutter there's one nervous",
    "i am you know ten of a back to school for respiratory therapy and now i'm working as an eke so my job is to stutter at squiggly lines all day",
    "with an early age and then again uh during college um aside from that most speech therapists i did not help at all in fact a lot made it worse",
    "i don't see very well so um that i would say the hundred i can carry uh tune and bucket",
    "and you know sometimes that's been a detriment but i think on the whole um you know it's probably made me a better person hmm i don't know um you know i would say uh uh learned about the",
    "let them create the energy they're on a agenda and don't follow the textbook just because chapter six of book whatever says you have to do this",
    "so it's nice to have you back uh it's nice to have family that has your back um that's kind of a hard question to answer but i think it's i don't know if this is i don't know if this answers the question but what makes my stutter worse is unknown it's hard for me to maintain uh the relations with friends",
    "but it took many years and it took a lot of um getting to know people and being around the stutter community",
    "um i did also attend the start book fluency clinic um at age thirteen and then at age forty and then came back as a refresher for a few years and mentor for a couple years and i believe it is no longer an existence um but that program was uh was helpful in a lot of ways to get to reduce my fear of speaking in public and to get my words out that doesn't give um to be in the moment or uh connect with other person or just enjoy the interaction",
    "it was at the same time scary frightening but also at the same time kind of anxiety because i don't like publicly speaking that much",
    "in a relatively clear and efficient manner not necessarily a fluent one and uh uh uh and a positive experience is being able to talk to my coworkers there's and discuss it's of but it's fairly common",
    "so um well um i could think of a whole lot um i definitely think i wouldn't have been the confident person that i am today",
    "or make fun of them back but in high school you know that's when like the full weight of stuttering really hit me um uh but then you know be beyond that in uh um the till and ais high school",
    "um effective communication i would say is when person speaking or acting is able to convey his or her thoughts effectively to the person receiving those common thoughts or what have you um i mean clearly being a social worker and therapist uh communication becomes of the um most important thing in life where stuttering may not be caused psychologically",
    "and then doing things like this uh for nsa and one of the things that i'm doing",
    " unless they ask um let them speak no matter how long it takes um don't laugh don't judge um and i think the biggest thing is just encourage people who stutter just to be themselves go up and speak in public",
    "get the curveball get the you know that um",
    "um who had an incredible who helped me tremendously yes charles dr charles darputter who really had a tremendous impact on me",
    "i always question like am i the one that stuttered how does impact future jobs could it's honestly past the fact that i stutter",
    "well or at least there um she didn't know quite everything about stuttering but she took the time out since i was oh and by the way so far all these therapists have been in our community service",
    "and the emotional aspect is four through five through six i was down on lunch school and i think that was a lot better control from the teachers because i had teacher to teacher",
    "i think exchange is probably a good word and i also feel like that um i guess the analogy is uh um i form a time teller story um with my mba trick we are with maybe a program",
    "um another family would mention the same thing and so i did go back um i went back my junior year of college",
    "uh it's a completely physical phenomenon and i'm not sure what that what the physical component is i tend to think some day there will be a public who cares it",
    "if you didn't stutter what might be different in your life i can give um a one word answer to that that would be everything absolutely everything would be different in my life",
    "and i guess i would have more friends for people who stutter or who stutter",
    "uh that of course didn't happen so but they we still stopped it and i didn't have to go past that again um after that it was graduate school that anxor a therapist",
    "because we need to look at the whole system and not just one piece i think that is happening",
    "so it's kind of like there's never really um like demonstrable but it's also very um a childhood that was very uh isolated because no one was asking how i speak",
    "i was told to slow down uh that was uh she had a good heart the speech therapist uh i what i got out of it was a person to talk to uh as far as the speech therapy uh i don't think it was uh productive and it made it better it was productive in that i had an adult talk",
    "but um yeah uh but in daily life with my family it isn't um an issue and uh i don't think uh about it when i go into stores or um order uh food which is a good thing um",
    "and i gave it that night i was nervous um i will say i was in all white so i looked good right",
    "because me as a child having someone else who has the same sort of challenges i have i would have listened to them i would not have cheated on my sentence had the speech like with the pathologist been someone no not at all",
    "and i trust myself now and i know that it doesn't define me it's part of who i am",
    "um i think lots of i guess that cause the actual physical mechanism that creates a disfluency it seems that most of the research is suggesting it's has uh genetic origins or you have a genetic predisposition to stutter",
    "in your voice oh gee i just want the maryland powerball",
    "i wouldn't have better grades all tell you that um just because uh uh i was based on a straightie student until second grade and then uh my participation in grade started to drop um just because i was more shying the classroom",
    "um so yeah i first got therapy when i was nineteen so it was somehow after my first year of college and um it was just a standard you know all well weekly sessions and you know at that point i was i was so new to the whole thing and i never seen a speech therapist before and i didn't quite know what to expect and uh she wasn't a bad uh uh therapist but i just i don't think i was fully knew what i was getting myself into or knew how to get the muscle out of it",
    "then you know sometimes a client could be having a uh bad day and you know they don't want to work on you know techniques or you know whatever you might have planned for them",
    "and every time i start stuttering um reminded of how my parents do not and will not understand my stuttering",
    "my mom is a person who stutters and so is my brother and i think that she didn't want to call too much attention to it which in retrospect wasn't the healthiest thing but i think she thought it would be best for me to kinda go into the radar",
    "i was also applying for your colleges i knew i had college interviews to do and i was just becoming more and more self conscious and also becoming more covert about my stuttering so i decided i needed help then that's when i got therapy which really changed the way i looked at my stuttering now go for it",
    "but i have a really good support system and i'm also not like a uh you know shy type of guy so you know i wouldn't say the effect on me is super high",
    "and i show my speech therapist tell me about like the avoidance behaviors and like secondary behaviors and so i like took notice of that and i try not to do that anymore but i think that's hard for me is like i contact is typical",
    "um it's a there's depending on the depth of it perhaps there's even a level of uh trust established um there's a relationship building",
    "then i go to dr drangers um lectures all the time and also dr maguire so it's a multifactorial multimotal cause",
    "you know just speaking for myself that you know that wasn't though uh the um the uh tools those were the tools for me um and so i kinda like uh settled with stuttering openly",
    "i've only had one therapeutic experience now is when i was in elementary school and the teacher was actually at the elementary school um but the lessons i've learned was to like breath through the words",
    "you know and so i she i really bonded with her psychologically because she made me realize that she really cared about me and with all my education and all the stuff she wouldn't let me get by with anything",
    "and i don't remember a lot of it but i think it helped me a lot but what helped me born in an undergraduate and even to now",
    "i might not be married to my wife or have my children or my house so uh i like where i'm at",
    "and then you know i was able to get over that and then i went to the peace core and in about my second year of that i got so frustrated again with my speech that i went to uh to the hollins uh fluency center or something",
    "great um well first i um i uh don't stutter nearly as much as i used to i um you know had some good therapy and all of that but as far as how it impacts me now i would say it impacts me in regard to the idea that it's pretty much what i do",
    "conference with us but there are things you can do and a couple of things come to mind",
    "i know that you can have a fluent person that has trauma and then they now i stutter always and that's you know i don't know",
    "in order to create that sort of intimacy in a conversation um but i think about it much less than i used to when i was still struggling with it i yeah",
    "most everything i suppose because like i was saying earlier about my whole career around stuttering and i'm a lot of my friends i met through stuttering my girl friend i met in memphis because i was going to school for stuttering in memphis",
    "so i'm sure for some people it's very different too and they know you know they know um",
    "through uh elementary school my first year junior high and i remember we played on the assignments as and that's about it",
    "yeah you know i mean you know i thought i was stupid i didn't have you know self worth",
    "i'd rather stutter and show the feeling and show the emotion so it's what i've accepted i think the jury is still out on that",
    "the person at times um i think anxiety is a major impact um i think hormones can have a major impact",
    "so you know that i can help other people with the experiences i've had related to stuttering um let's see um what i've seen that um it's seems like it's a combination of um uh like uh that i can help other people with the experiences i've had related to stuttering um let's see um what i've seen that um it's seems like it's a combination of um uh like uh that i can help other people with the experiences i've had related to stuttering",
    "but once that was filled it was okay that was like a huge load off my back and everything else got easier yeah so i think that i know now there's a lot of research about genetics in stuttering",
    "i don't know but i switch from that to respiratory care so that would definitely have been an impact that",
    "and for her she's having to learn so how is it impacted my life my conness uh how has it not impacted my life everything about my life has everything that i've done in my life has been impacted by how i talk",
    "the fluency shaping games are almost impossible to both transfer and maintain uh uh uh uh uh because what they ask of you they ask that you uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh process language in a different part of the brain",
    "um and that was the last time i received therapy i left there still stuttering quite severely but with a change with a changed attitude and but i would say the biggest change in my speech happened in grad school um where it was a lot of self therapy i guess",
    "or just people only can stutter and common so sorry about that um as far as three um",
    "i think his jokes are horrible but um he's a very good character that is a good example where the voice don't make fun of him for stuttering",
    "although it's been fifteen years ago to call your center here in dallas",
    "with you know you know had a lot of hope but uh not a lot of uh actual relief uh you know i mean i've i did everything from you know hypno therapy",
    "some suicide attempts bullying on and on and on",
    "i work in a job so i have to um be professional and not stutter that much um but in my daily life with friends and family some so it doesn't really have an impact on me i think um because everyone knows that i stutter and it's just a part of me and it's the way i talk i guess uh",
    "um uh if hollabies are part of community activities uh um from eighteen to thirty two i was uh competing in amateur uh amateur all the racing uh the uh with the sports club of america scca uh my in my like twenty's i was also a part of that race uh",
    "so i got the most out of that because she made me practice successful communication means delivering your message",
    "um i think communication is successful when the two or multiple parties can comprehend each other and so like if there's understanding with what's said no matter how it's said i think that's good communication",
    "um i think that for me i feel like i'm a successful communicator when i'm saying what i wanna say when i wanna say it and when i'm open with people about my stuttering and i'm not trying to avoid stuttering and i think an example of when i was successful is recently i was interviewing for jobs um",
    "um but overall i think that stuttering has helped me because it did lead me to my job and my career and hopefully a long career ahead of me i guess one thought that i would say is that stuttering's more complex than you could see um and also stuttering varies tremendously from day to day",
    "or if i have different tone so i don't know that one so i'm not sure what pre events stuttering for my car is if there is a cause",
    "find a way to you know be comfortable with yourself that's you know i hear talk of the cure and this and that",
    "and that i think what speech therapists especially need to bear in mind when they're working people who stutter is that the stutter itself is not the problem it's the effort spent in wrestling with the stutter and then i think it's possible to stutter without effort",
    "um yeah successful communication i guess that would mean getting your message across um as best as possible",
    "i forgot something um going back to question three um different um i forgot to mention my parents",
    "so i was a therapy person as a social worker as a supervisor as a presenter as a speaker however you want to look at it people tend to open up to me a quite a lot faster",
    "and one experience that she had uh that was almost a negative was that she walked into a donut shop trying to order something and the girl behind the counter was doing this and instantly she went to walk out of the store but she held her composure and ordered what she wanted and she went out of the store for eight months uh last year and she lives in oklahoma",
    "assuming i started stuttering in elementary school but all throughout like my school days i went to speech therapy um in school and i was working on fluency shaping techniques",
    "i enjoy people's response i really actually am entertained by the facial expressions i get when i'm putting on a little bit more and people provide faces that you could almost see of a stuttered day night life skype money",
    "and by the time of then if that speech therapy session i was unnormal you can tell i stuttered i did not identify someone that stuttered",
    "and you know other uh self help groups it has led me to pursuing um a uh career and speech pathology um so uh it's so there are some positive aspects of stuttering",
    "and kind of did it just to get out there and just kind of just do stuff um and really wouldn't i don't think in fact that much people probably tell us this earlier",
    "so uh really positive experience that i had recently was where i gave a keynote speech um at a nonprofit organization it was a fundraiser gala and i'm a graduate of the program and there i was speaking to over two hundred and fifty wealthy individuals who were looking to uh support our cause and i gave about an eight minute speech in front of these people and it was extremely nerve racking but i enjoyed it tremendously and i received it from outside of hi how are you how's it going",
    "i think that the most is that the people who stutter um like like the kind of therapy that they are getting so maybe like ask",
    "and uh and i think having a speech impediment uh it helped me empathize with uh the clientele that we were uh assisting with um uh um there were few who led to sooner speech impediment uh some just connected me with because uh i was maybe thought as other as"
